<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Is Alternative Medicine as Effective as “Mainstream” Medicine?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Actress and television host Jenny McCarthy made headlines when she refused doctors’ advice for how to treat her autistic son. Instead, she worked with nutritionists and placed her son, Evan, on a strict gluten- and casein-free diet, in the hope that it would minimize his symptoms. Alternative therapies, such as the one McCarthy followed, are being explored by a record high number of people today and are slowly gaining acceptance by the mainstream medical community.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Medical sociologists refer to such unorthodox medical practices as <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-complementary-and-alternative-medicine-cam-" href="part0119_split_005.html#complementary-and-alternative-medicine-cam-">complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)</a>. CAM encompasses a diverse set of approaches and therapies for treating illness and promoting well-being that generally fall outside standard medical practices. These approaches are usually not taught in medical schools and not practiced by physicians or other professionals trained in medical programs. However, in recent years, medical and nursing schools have started offering courses in alternative medicine (Fenton and Morris, 2003). Examples of common CAM therapies include chiropractic, massage, deep-breathing techniques, homeopathy, reflexology, herbal remedies, and acupuncture. Complementary medicine is distinct from alternative medicine in that the former is meant to be used in conjunction with medical procedures to increase their efficacy or reduce side effects, while the latter is meant to be used in place of standard medical procedures (Saks, 1992). Some alternative approaches, such as homeopathy, reject the basis of orthodox medicine entirely.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Industrialized countries have some of the best-developed, best-resourced medical facilities in the world. Why, then, are a growing number of people exploring treatments that have not yet proven effective in controlled clinical trials, such as aromatherapy and hypnotherapy? It has been estimated that as many as 1 in 10 Americans has at some time consulted an alternative practitioner. An even larger proportion of Americans have sought out CAM treatments on their own. A recent survey conducted by the CDC and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_751" title="751"></span>found that 33 percent of American adults had used some form of CAM in the past year (Clarke et al., 2015). CAM use is more frequent among women and individuals with higher levels of educational attainment. Furthermore, Whites are more likely to use CAM than their Black and Asian counterparts. The most common reasons people use such treatments are back, neck, and joint pain (Barnes, Bloom, and Nahin, 2008).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are many reasons for seeking the services of an alternative-medicine practitioner or pursuing CAM regimens on one’s own. Some people perceive orthodox medicine to be deficient or ineffective in relieving chronic pain or symptoms of stress and anxiety. Others are dissatisfied with features of modern health care systems such as long waits, referrals through chains of specialists, and financial restrictions. Connected to this dissatisfaction are concerns about the harmful side effects of medication and the intrusiveness of surgery, both staples of modern Western medicine. The asymmetrical power relationship between doctors and patients also drives some people to seek alternative medicine. Those people feel that the role of the passive patient does not grant them enough input into their own treatment and healing. Finally, some individuals profess religious or philosophical objections to orthodox medicine, which treats the mind and body separately. They believe that orthodox medicine often overlooks the spiritual and psychological dimensions of health and illness. All these concerns are critiques of the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-biomedical-model-of-health" href="part0119_split_005.html#biomedical-model-of-health">biomedical model of health</a> (the foundation of the Western medical establishment), which defines disease in objective terms and believes that scientifically based medical treatment can restore the body to health (Beyerstein, 1999).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The growth of alternative medicine is a fascinating reflection of the transformations occurring within modern societies. We are living in an age where much more information is available to draw on when making choices. The proliferation of health-related websites such as WebMD and MedicineNet and fitness trackers such as Fitbit provide instant access to information on health symptoms and treatments. Thus, individuals are increasingly becoming health consumers, adopting an active stance toward their own health and well-being. Not only are we choosing the type of practitioners to consult, but we are also demanding more involvement in our own care and treatment.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Members of the mainstream medical community, once viewed as completely resistant to the notion of alternative medicine, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_752" title="752"></span>are increasingly taking a more open-minded approach to such therapies. Many now cautiously endorse patients’ desires to consult an ever-expanding array of medical information. However, medical leaders believe that CAM should be given the same level of scientific scrutiny as mainstream medicine: It should be held up to rigorous scientific evaluation. Former editors of <i class="italic">The New England Journal of Medicine</i> Marcia Angell and Jerome Kassirer (1998) have observed that “many alternative remedies have recently found their way into the medical mainstream. . . . There cannot be two kinds of medicine—conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted.” Most experts conclude that alternative medicine is unlikely to overtake mainstream health care altogether, but that its usage will continue to grow.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One hotly contested alternative treatment today is medical marijuana. As of 2020, 32 of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia had legalized marijuana for medical use, and seven states and the District of Columbia had legalized marijuana for recreational use. According to national surveys, 91 percent of Americans support the legal use of marijuana for medical and recreational purposes (Daniller, 2019). Advocates of medical marijuana cite clinical trial data to show that it helps soothe pain and allay nausea, especially for patients of fibromyalgia, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, some <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_753" title="753"></span>cancers, and neuropathy (e.g., Campbell et al., 2001). By contrast, opponents question such findings, challenging the researchers’ methods, and arguing that some conditions, such as schizophrenia, may be exacerbated by smoking pot. Further, some argue that marijuana is less effective in treating symptoms than medications, which patients may eschew if they have easy access to pot. Others argue that enhanced access to marijuana will increase drug use, especially among teens (Jacobson, 2014). However, the majority of doctors agree with the general conclusion of Angell and Kassirer (1998), that mainstream and alternative remedies are best used in tandem.</p>
