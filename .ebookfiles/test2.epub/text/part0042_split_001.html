<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The “sense of belonging” that characterizes social groups is sometimes strengthened by scorning other groups (Sartre, 1965; orig. 1948). This is especially true of racist groups, which promote their identity as superior by hating “inferior” groups. Jews, Catholics, African Americans and other people of color, immigrants, and gay people historically—and Muslims more recently—have been the targets of such prejudice in the United States. This sense of group identity created through scorn is dramatically illustrated by the website rantings of a racist skinhead group called Combat 18 (1998): “We are the last of our warrior race, and it is our duty to fight for our people. The Jew will do everything to discredit us, but we hold that burning flame in our hearts that drove our ancestors to conquer whole continents.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Such proud, disdainful language illustrates the sociological distinction between in-groups and out-groups. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-in-groups" href="part0042_split_005.html#in-groups">In-groups</a> are groups toward which one feels loyalty and respect—the groups that “we” belong to. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-out-groups" href="part0042_split_005.html#out-groups">Out-groups</a> are groups toward which one feels antagonism and contempt—“those people.” At one time or another, many of us have used in-group/out-group imagery to trumpet what we believe to be our group’s strengths vis-à-vis another group’s presumed weaknesses. For example, fraternity or sorority members may bolster their feelings of superiority—in academics, sports, or campus image—by ridiculing the members of a different house. Similarly, a church may hold up its “truths” as the only ones, while native-born Americans may accuse immigrants—always outsiders upon arriving in a new country—as ruining the country for “real Americans.”</p>
