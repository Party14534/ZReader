<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Will Global Population Growth Outstrip Resources?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">During the rise of industrialism, many looked forward to a new age in which food scarcity would be a phenomenon of the past. The development of modern industry, it was widely supposed, would create a new era of abundance. In his celebrated work <i class="italic">Essay on the Principle of Population</i> (2003; orig. 1798), Thomas Malthus criticized these ideas and initiated a debate about the connection between population and food resources that continues to this day.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">At the time Malthus wrote, the population of Europe was growing rapidly. Malthus pointed out that whereas population growth is exponential, food supply depends on fixed resources that can be expanded only by developing new land for cultivation. Population growth therefore tends to outstrip the means of support available. The inevitable outcome is famine, which, combined with the influence of war and plagues, acts as a natural limit to population increase. Malthus predicted that human beings would always live in circumstances of misery and starvation, unless they practiced what he called “moral restraint.” His cure for excessive population growth was for people to delay marriage and to strictly limit their frequency of sexual intercourse. (The use of contraception, he proclaimed to be a “vice.”)</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For a while, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-malthusianism" href="part0125_split_003.html#malthusianism">Malthusianism</a> was ignored. The population development of the Western countries followed a quite different pattern from that which he had anticipated. Rates of population growth trailed off in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Indeed, in the 1930s, there were major worries about population decline in many industrialized <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_809" title="809"></span>countries, including the United States. Malthus also failed to consider that technology that fostered increases in food production would be developed in the modern era. However, the upsurge in world population growth in the twentieth century has again lent some credence to Malthus’s views. Population expansion in the global south seemed to be outstripping the resources that those countries could generate to feed their citizenry—especially in nations that suffered from such natural disasters as droughts and floods that hurt local food supplies.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Malthusian arguments got a boost when the biologist Paul Ehrlich published his best-selling book <i class="italic">The Population Bomb</i> in 1968. Ehrlich (1968) predicted a catastrophic global collapse, as an exploding world population vastly outstripped global food production. Famine would overtake India and other populous countries, and hundreds of millions of people would perish in the coming decades. His arguments received support from another study published a few years later. The authors of <i class="italic">The Limits to Growth</i> (Meadows et al., 1972) used advanced (for the time) computer-simulation modeling to project the complex interaction of five factors they believed to be key to understanding the earth–human system interrelationship: population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion. Their predictions were dire: a high likelihood of global agricultural and economic collapse by the mid- to late-twenty-first century. Ehrlich updated (and reaffirmed) his arguments some 20 years <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_810" title="810"></span>later in <i class="italic">The Population Explosion</i> (Ehrlich and Ehrlich, 1990), and he gave even more dire predictions in a keynote address to the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association in 2012.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Famine and food shortages are indeed a serious concern. About 795 million people in the world suffer from hunger or undernourishment (UN Food and Agriculture Organization, 2015). In some parts of the world, more than a third of the population is undernourished. As the population rises, levels of food output will need to rise accordingly to avoid widespread scarcity. Yet many of the world’s poorest areas are particularly affected by water shortages, shrinking farmland, and soil degradation—processes that reduce, rather than enhance, agricultural productivity. It is almost certain in such areas that food production will not occur at a level to ensure self-sufficiency. Large amounts of food and grain will need to be imported from areas where there are surpluses.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">On the other hand, as noted at the beginning of this chapter, the most widely accepted prediction of global population sees a leveling off at 10–12.5 billion people by the end of the century, the result of a “second demographic transition,” which, contrary to Malthusian predictions, would result in lower (rather than higher) fertility. Having a large number of children may make sense in preindustrial countries, where child mortality is high and children provide an important source of labor on family farms, but in modern industrial societies, large families can be an economic cost rather than an asset: Children tend to be economic consumers rather than producers. As more and more countries in the global south are brought into the global economy, the reasoning goes, they will undergo their own demographic transition to a low mortality/low fertility equilibrium, thereby radically slowing population growth. Population may in fact initially surge: As countries in the global south adopt modern farming technology and public health measures developed in industrial nations, mortality will decline. But eventually, fertility will follow suit, and a low-growth equilibrium will result. Among industrial economies, such as Germany, Italy, Japan, and Russia, fertility has dropped below replacement levels, resulting in a declining population, at least among the native-born population. (Growth in such cases can occur only through immigration.)</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Moreover, doomsday predictions have long underestimated global increases in food production, which, thanks in part to advances in farming technology, have so far managed to keep pace with population growth. According to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, even the projected population growth to 2050 can be accommodated by increased food supply—if certain conditions are met: drawing on additional (but available) land and water resources, higher crop yields, and preserving biodiversity. The study concludes:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to FAO’s baseline projections, it should be possible to meet the future food and feed demand of the projected world population in 2050 within realistic rates for land and water use expansion and yield development. However, achieving this will not at all be automatic and several significant challenges will have to be met. . . . The conditions under which this can be achieved are strong economic growth, global expansion of food supplies by about 70 percent, relatively high production growth in many developing countries achievable through growing capital <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_811" title="811"></span>stock, higher productivity and global trade helping the low income food deficit countries to close their import gaps for cereals and other food products at affordable prices. (UN Food and Agriculture Organization, 2011)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The key problem, according to this view, is not that population growth is outstripping food production, as Malthus predicted more than 200 years ago; it is that the results of increased agricultural productivity are not equitably distributed. The counterargument to Malthusian pessimism, simply stated, lies neither with the biological food-producing capacity of the planet nor with the failure of agricultural technology to keep pace. It lies with the fact that a small proportion of the world’s population consumes a vastly unequal proportion of the world’s natural resources. The solutions, in other words, are to be found in societal terms, not a biological imperative. Karl Marx (1977, 1993), in his criticism of Malthus, argued that starvation results not from overpopulation, but rather an economic system that enables the capitalist class to enjoy the fruits of production (including food) at the expense of everyone else. The solution, in Marx’s view, was neither war, pestilence, nor famine, but rather communism, an economic system that he thought would provide adequate food for workers and farmers, and also enable them to self-regulate their population growth rate.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What will be the consequences of these changes? Some observers see the makings of widespread social upheaval—particularly in countries in the global south undergoing demographic transition. The rapid growth of cities will be likely to lead to environmental damage, new public health risks, overloaded infrastructures, rising crime, and impoverished squatter settlements. Changes in the economy and labor markets may prompt widespread internal migration as people in rural areas search for work. Warfare and civic violence also cause people to migrate. Civil war in Syria, along with the rise of radical Islamist movements in the Middle East and North Africa, have laid waste to entire cities. Millions of refugees have fled war-torn countries as a result. In 2015 alone, it is estimated that 1.3 million migrants fled to Europe seeking asylum, with Germany the destination of choice (BBC, 2016). Many paid large sums of money to risk a hazardous crossing of the Mediterranean in flimsy, greatly overloaded rafts; more than 7,000 paid with their lives by the end of 2015 (Hume, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Refugees, like all migrants, seek out major cities, where the possibility of finding work is the greatest. This enormous movement of people has placed significant strains on the resources of the destination countries. While Germany was initially among the most generous of countries in opening its doors to refugees, by 2016, even Germany began to close its borders. Other countries responded far more harshly: Those bordering on Greece—a destination of choice for many migrants since the water crossing from Turkey to the Greek island of Samos is only five miles—closed their borders in 2015, stranding many migrants in one of Europe’s poorest countries.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Technological advances in agriculture and industry are unpredictable, so no one can be sure how large a population the world might eventually be able to support. Even if technological solutions are found, will they be used to benefit those in the poorest regions of the world, who face the most dire Malthusian prospects—or to increase the consumption of those in relatively wealthy countries, who are most likely to be insulated from catastrophic collapse?</p>
