<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Fordism and Scientific Management (Taylorism)</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Alongside these changes in the nature of capitalist economic systems, there has also been a change in the predominant type of industrial organization in capitalist economies. This change involves a shift from mass production in large bureaucratic organizations for a mass consumer market to more flexible forms of production through global networks of suppliers, tailored to more individualized consumer tastes. Because the former emerged with the modern automobile industry, it is sometimes called “Fordism.” <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-fordism" href="part0092_split_005.html#fordism">Fordism</a>, therefore, is the name given to designate the system of mass production tied to the cultivation of mass markets. Affixing the prefix <i class="italic">post</i> to <i class="italic">Fordism</i> (post-Fordism) suggests that Fordism is being replaced by something entirely new, signaling the end of the Fordist era. This view is misleading, since both forms of industrial organization are found throughout the world today, although these new forms are becoming increasingly important, as we shall see.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Writing more than two centuries ago, Adam Smith, one of the founders of modern economics, identified advantages that the division of labor provides in terms of increasing productivity. His most famous work, <i class="italic">The Wealth of Nations</i> (1776), opens with a description of the division of labor in a pin factory. A person working alone could perhaps make 20 pins per day. By breaking down that worker’s task into a number of simple operations, however, 10 workers carrying out specialized jobs in collaboration with one another could collectively produce 48,000 pins per day. The rate of production per worker, in other words, is increased from 20 to 4,800, with each specialist operator producing 240 times more than he or she could if working alone.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">More than a century later, these ideas reached their most developed expression in the writings of Frederick Winslow Taylor, an American management consultant. Taylor’s approach to what he called “scientific <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_518" title="518"></span>management” involved the detailed study of industrial processes to break them down into simple operations that could be precisely timed and organized. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-taylorism" href="part0092_split_005.html#taylorism">Taylorism</a>, as scientific management came to be called, was not merely an academic study. It was also a system of production designed to maximize industrial output, and it had a widespread effect not only on the organization of industrial production and technology but also on workplace politics. In particular, Taylor’s time and motion studies wrested control over knowledge of the production process from the worker and placed such knowledge firmly in the hands of management, eroding the basis on which craft workers maintained autonomy from their employers (Braverman, 1974). As such, Taylorism has been widely associated with the de-skilling, degradation, and control of labor.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The industrialist Henry Ford adopted the principles of Taylorism. In 1908, Ford designed his first auto plant in Highland Park, Michigan, to manufacture only one product, the Model T, thereby allowing the introduction of specialized tools and machinery designed for speed, precision, and simplicity of operation. One of Ford’s most significant innovations was the introduction of the assembly line, said to have been inspired by Chicago slaughterhouses in which animals were disassembled section by section on a moving conveyor belt. Each worker on Ford’s assembly line was assigned a specialized task, such as fitting the left-side door handles as the car bodies moved along the line. By 1929, when production of the Model T ceased, more than 15 million cars had been assembled.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Ford was among the first to realize that mass production requires mass markets. He reasoned that if standardized commodities such as the automobile were to be produced on an ever-greater scale, the presence of consumers who were able to buy those commodities must also be ensured. In 1914, Ford took the unprecedented step of unilaterally raising wages at his Dearborn, Michigan, plant to $5 for an eight-hour day—a very generous wage at the time and one that ensured a working-class lifestyle that included owning an automobile. As David Harvey (1990) remarks, “The purpose of <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_519" title="519"></span>the five-dollar, eight-hour day was only in part to secure worker compliance with the discipline required to work the highly productive assembly-line system. It was coincidentally meant to provide workers with sufficient income and leisure time to consume the mass-produced products the corporations were about to turn out in ever vaster quantities.” Ford also enlisted the services of a small army of social workers, who were sent into the homes of workers to educate them in the proper habits of consumption.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">“Fordism” is also sometimes used to refer to a historical period in the development of post–World War II capitalism in which mass production was associated with relative stability in labor relations and a high degree of unionization. Under Fordism, firms made long-term commitments to workers, and wages were tightly linked to productivity growth. Collective-bargaining agreements—formal agreements negotiated between firms and unions—provided for rising wages, seniority rights, and benefits in exchange for worker consent to increasingly automated systems of production. The rising wages also helped to ensure that there was sufficient demand for the mass-produced commodities. Worker strife was not absent from this system, and the heyday of Fordism—the period from the end of World War II (1945) to the early 1970s, when the American economy was rapidly expanding—was marked by dozens of major strikes and countless lesser ones. Workers in industries large and small walked off the job to demand their share of the growing economic pie. From the Great Strike Wave of 1946, which cut across many industries and utilities, to the automobile workers’ strikes of the early 1970s, workers—backed by strong unions—fought hard for rising wages and fair working conditions.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The system is generally understood to have broken down in the 1970s, giving rise to greater “post-Fordist” flexibility, with resulting insecurity in working conditions. The reasons for the declining importance of Fordism are complex and intensely debated. As firms in a variety of industries adopted Fordist production methods, the system encountered certain limitations. Fordism was not suitable for all industries; it could be applied successfully only to industries that produced standardized commodities for large markets. At one time, it looked as though Fordism represented the likely future of industrial production as a whole. This has not proven to be the case. Setting up mechanized production lines is enormously expensive, and once a Fordist system is established, it is quite rigid; to alter a product, for example, requires substantial reinvestment. Fordist production is easy to copy if sufficient funding is available to set up the plant. But firms in countries in which labor power is expensive find it difficult to compete with those where wages are cheaper. This was one of the factors originally leading to the rise of the car industry in Japan (although Japanese wage levels today are no longer low), followed by South Korea, and more recently China.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Work and Alienation</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Fordism and Taylorism involve what some industrial sociologists call <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-low-trust-systems" href="part0092_split_005.html#low-trust-systems">low-trust systems</a>. Jobs are set by management and are geared to machines. Those who carry out the work tasks are closely supervised and are allowed little autonomy of action. Where there are many low-trust positions, the level of worker dissatisfaction and absenteeism <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_520" title="520"></span>is high, and industrial conflict is common. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-high-trust-systems" href="part0092_split_005.html#high-trust-systems">High-trust systems</a> are those in which workers are permitted to control the pace and even the content of their work, within overall guidelines. Such systems are usually concentrated at the higher levels of industrial organizations.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Karl Marx was one of the first writers to grasp that the development of modern industry would reduce many people’s work to dull, uninteresting tasks, resulting—to use today’s language—in low-trust systems. According to Marx, the division of labor alienates human beings from their work. For Marx, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-alienation" href="part0092_split_005.html#alienation">alienation</a> refers to feelings of estrangement and even hostility—initially to one’s job and eventually to the overall framework of capitalist-industrial production. In Marx’s view, workers in a capitalist society lack ownership of the products they make, which they often cannot even afford to buy; they are dehumanized by tedious and demeaning labor processes over which they have no control; and they find themselves in competition with their fellow workers for scarce jobs. Marx saw this situation as counter to human nature, which he believed involved creativity, control over one’s activities, and cooperation with others (Marx, 2000; orig. 1844; Appelbaum, 1988). In traditional societies, he pointed out, work was often exhausting—peasant farmers sometimes had to toil from dawn to dusk. Yet peasants held a real measure of control over their work, which required considerable knowledge and skill. Many industrial workers, by contrast, have little control over their jobs, contribute only a fraction to the creation of the overall product, and have no influence over how or to whom it is eventually sold. Work thus appears as something alien, a task that the worker must carry out to earn an income but that is in itself unsatisfying.</p>
