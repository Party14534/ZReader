<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Marx: Capitalism and the Analysis of Class</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For many people, the word <i class="italic">capitalism</i> refers to a free-market economy, a system in which economic exchanges are essentially deregulated and occur through supply and demand. In a capitalist system, wealth is privately owned and is invested and reinvested to produce profit. But for Marx and his followers, it is impossible to define capitalism without reference to the classes that emerge through capitalism.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These are the groups of people who have a common relationship to the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-means-of-production" href="part0055_split_005.html#means-of-production">means of production</a>—the means by which they gain a livelihood. In modern societies, the two main classes are the bourgeoisie and proletariat. The <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-bourgeoisie" href="part0055_split_005.html#bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a>, or capitalists, own the means of production. Members of the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-proletariat" href="part0055_split_005.html#proletariat">proletariat</a>, or proletarians, by contrast, earn their living by selling their labor to the capitalists. The relationship between <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_251" title="251"></span>classes, according to Marx, is exploitative. During the working day, workers produce more than employers actually need to repay the cost of hiring them. This <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-surplus-value" href="part0055_split_005.html#surplus-value">surplus value</a> is the source of profit, which capitalists put to their own use.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Marx (1977; orig. 1867) believed that the maturing of industrial capitalism would create an increasing gap between the wealth of the minority and the poverty of the mass of the population, and he has been proven correct. Yet, he was not correct about everything. In his view, the wages of the working class could never rise far above subsistence level, while wealth would pile up in the hands of those owning capital. In addition, he claimed laborers would daily face work that was physically tasking and mentally tedious, as in many factories. At the lowest levels of society, particularly among those frequently or permanently unemployed, there would develop an “accumulation of misery, agony of labor, slavery, ignorance, brutality, moral degradation.” Because of this accumulation, Marx concluded, the working class would eventually rise up and overthrow the capitalist system that was oppressing them. This revolution would then usher in a classless society in which technology replaced much of human labor, with everyone working together for the common good. He termed this system <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-communism" href="part0055_split_005.html#communism">communism</a>, common ownership of the means of production.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Marx was right about the persistence of poverty in industrialized countries and in anticipating continued inequalities of wealth and income. He was wrong in supposing that the income of most of the population would remain extremely low. Most people in Western countries today are much better off materially than were comparable groups in Marx’s day. Marx was also wrong in believing that a classless society—a communist utopia in which everyone shared equally in the fruits of their common labor—would inevitably result—unless that classless society is still to come, 150 years after the publication of his work.</p>
