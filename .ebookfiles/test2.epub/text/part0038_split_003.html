<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">To What Extent Can Electronic Communication Substitute for Face-to-Face Communication?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In modern societies, we are constantly interacting with others whom we may never see or meet. Almost all our everyday transactions, such as buying groceries or making a bank deposit, bring us into contact—but indirect contact—with people who may live thousands of miles away. The banking system, for example, is international. Any money you deposit is a small part of the financial investments the bank makes worldwide.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some people are concerned that the rapid advances in communication technology, such as email, the Internet, e-commerce, and social media, will only increase this tendency toward indirect interactions. More than two-thirds (69 percent) of all U.S. adults are on Facebook, with fully 74 percent visiting the site at least once a day (Perrin and Anderson, 2019). Among Facebook users, 7 percent say they are connected to people they have never met in person (Hampton, Gulet, and Purcell, 2011). Now that email, social networking sites, and electronic discussion groups have become facts of life for many people in industrialized countries, it is important to ask, what is the nature of these interactions and what new complexities are emerging from them?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Our society is becoming “devoiced,” some claim, as the capabilities of technology grow ever greater. According to this view, as the pace of life accelerates, people are increasingly isolating themselves; we now interact more with our televisions and computers than with our neighbors or members of the community. Some researchers conclude that the substitution of email for face-to-face communication has led to a weakening of social ties and a disruption of techniques used in personal <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_161" title="161"></span>dialogue for avoiding conflict. Further, online communication seems to allow more room for misinterpretation, confusion, and abuse than more traditional forms of communication (Friedman and Currall, 2003).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many Internet enthusiasts, however, disagree. They argue that social relations continue to thrive and might even be facilitated by frequent online communication (Hampton et al., 2011; Wellman, 2008). Far from being impersonal, they argue, online communication has many inherent advantages that cannot be claimed by more traditional forms of interaction such as the telephone and face-to-face meetings. The human voice, for example, may be far superior in terms of expressing emotion and subtleties of meaning, but it can also convey information about the speaker’s age, gender, ethnicity, or social position—information that could be used to the speaker’s disadvantage. Electronic communication, it is noted, masks all these identifying markers and ensures that attention focuses strictly on the content of the message. This can be a great advantage for women or other traditionally disadvantaged groups whose opinions are sometimes devalued in other settings (Locke and Pascoe, 2000). Electronic interaction is often presented as liberating and empowering because people can create their own online identities and can speak more freely than they would elsewhere.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Recent research shows that social networking may even enhance social integration and friendships (Hampton et al., 2011). A national survey conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life Project reports that persons who use social networking sites are more trusting, have more close relationships, receive more emotional and practical social support, and are more politically engaged than those who do not use such sites. For many people, online relationships are quite meaningful. Further, people can communicate with those who don’t share their geographic region; perhaps you have reconnected via Facebook with childhood friends who live hundreds of miles away.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Who is right in this debate? How far can electronic communication substitute for face-to-face interaction? Sociologists Deirdre Boden and Harvey Molotch (1994) argue that there is no substitute for face-to-face interaction. They argue further that humans have a true need for personal interaction, which they call the “<a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-compulsion" href="part0038_split_004.html#compulsion">compulsion of proximity</a>.” People put themselves out to attend meetings, Boden and Molotch suggest, because situations of copresence (for reasons documented by Goffman in his studies of interaction) provide much richer information about how other people think and feel, and about their sincerity, than any form of electronic communication. Only by actually being in the presence of people who make decisions affecting us in important ways do we feel able to learn what is going on and feel confident that we can impress them with our own views and our sincerity. “Co-presence,” Boden and Molotch (1994) say, “affects access to the body part that ‘never lies’: the eyes, the ‘windows on the soul.’ Eye contact itself signals a degree of intimacy and trust; co-present interactants continuously monitor the subtle movements of this most subtle body part.”</p>
