<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Religion in the United States</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we noted earlier, in comparison with citizens of other industrial nations, Americans are highly religious. Even though secularization may have weakened the power of religious institutions in the United States, it has not significantly diminished the strength of religious beliefs. In 2017, more than half (53 percent) of all American adults said religion is “very important” in their lives, a slight decline from 2007 (when it was 56 percent); 89 percent reported believing in God (down from 92 percent), while 55 percent said they pray daily (down from 58 percent) (Pew Research Center, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet one long-term measure of religiosity, based on indicators such as belief in God, religious membership, and attendance at religious services, found that the index reached its highest levels in the 1950s and has declined ever since—in part because post–World War II baby boomers were less religious, at least in the traditional sense, than their predecessors (Roof, 1999). In one national survey, overwhelming majorities of Catholics, liberal Protestants, and conservative Protestants reported attending church weekly while they were children, although their attendance had dropped sharply by the time they reached their early twenties. Among the three groups, attendance had declined the most among liberal Protestants and the least among conservative Protestants (Roof, 1999).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another survey of nearly 114,000 adults in 1990 and more than 50,000 adults in 2007 found that religious identification had declined sharply during the 17-year period. In 1990, 90 percent of all respondents identified with some religious group; in 2007, the figure was 83 percent. By 2014, the proportion of American adults who were religiously affiliated had dropped even further, to 77 percent. The principal decline has been among self-identified Christians (from 78 percent in 2007 to 71 percent in 2014), specifically mainline Protestants and Catholics. In contrast, the number of adults who report no religious affiliation is growing, referred to as the “rise of the nones.” In 2019, religious “nones”—people who identify as atheists or agnostics or who say their religion is “nothing in particular”—comprised nearly a quarter (26 percent) of the U.S. adult population, up from 16 percent in 2007. Much of this growth can be tied to generational replacement: 40 percent of millennials are religiously unaffiliated (Pew Research Center, 2019c).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Civil Religion</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although there is a constitutional separation of church and state in the United States, all U.S. presidents have attended church, and some have been deeply and publicly <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_675" title="675"></span>religious. In fact, sociologists have argued that the United States has a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-civil-religion" href="part0111_split_007.html#civil-religion">civil religion</a>—a set of religious beliefs through which a society interprets its own history in light of some conception of ultimate reality (Bellah, 1968, 1975). Civil religion usually consists of “god-language used in reference to the nation,” including “historical myths about the society’s divine origins, beliefs about its sacred historical purpose, and occasionally religious restrictions on societal membership” (Wuthnow, 1988). The notion that westward expansion in the nineteenth century was America’s “Manifest Destiny” is one example.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The importance of civil religion in the United States is seen in the Pledge of Allegiance. By referring to “one nation, under God,” the pledge infuses civic life with a religious belief derived from the Judeo-Christian heritage. Congress added the phrase “under God” in 1954, during the height of Cold War fears about “godless communism.” Even though the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution calls for a separation of church and state, the Pledge posits a theistic religious belief as central to U.S. citizenship. Every president of the United States, whether religious or not, professes to be so and regularly attends church.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Constitutional separation of church and state notwithstanding, many Americans believe that the United States is fundamentally a Christian nation. Growing religious diversity is challenging this assumption. While Americans often pride themselves on the right of everyone to freely pursue their own faiths, they seldom actually interact <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_676" title="676"></span>with people who do not share the same beliefs and so have little understanding of religious differences. Sociologist Robert Wuthnow (2007), whose research focuses on the effects of religious diversity, calls for a strategy of “reflective pluralism” as a means to promote greater religious understanding.</p>

<section id="trends-in-religious-affiliation">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Trends in Religious Affiliation</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One reason so many Americans are religiously affiliated is that religious organizations are an important source of social ties and friendship networks. Churches, synagogues, and mosques are communities of people with shared beliefs and values who support one another during times of need. Religious communities thus often play a family-like role. About 67.3 percent of Americans identify as Christian (including 21 percent who identify as Catholic), 1.9 percent as Jewish, 0.9 percent as Muslim, 0.7 percent as Buddhist, and 0.7 percent as Hindu (CIA, 2020c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Protestantism: The Growing Strength of Conservative Denominations</b> A clearer picture of trends in American religion emerges if we break down the Protestant category into major subgroups. According to the U.S. Religious Landscape Survey of more than 35,000 adults in 2014, Baptist households account for 33 percent of all Protestants. There were far fewer Methodists (10 percent), Pentecostals (10 percent), Lutherans (8 percent), Presbyterians (5 percent), and Episcopalians (3 percent). More than half of all Protestants (55 percent) describe themselves as evangelical (Pew Research Center, 2015c). These figures indicate the growing strength of conservative Protestants, who emphasize a literal interpretation of the Bible, morality in daily life, and conversion through evangelizing. In contrast are the more historically established liberal (or mainline) Protestants, who adopt a more flexible, humanistic approach to religious practice. Somewhere in between are moderate Protestants.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Since the 1960s, the more liberal Protestant churches have experienced declining membership, whereas the number of evangelical Protestants has increased: The more evangelical denominations inspire deep loyalty and commitment, and are highly effective at recruiting new members, particularly young people. Today, 25 percent of all American adults belong to evangelical Protestant churches, compared with only 15 percent belonging to more liberal ones (Pew Research Center, 2015c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Liberal Protestantism in particular has suffered. The aging members of the liberal Protestant denominations have not been replaced, commitment is low, and some current members are switching to other faiths. From 1965 to 1989—a time when mainline Protestant denominations began to decline in favor of evangelical churches—losses were substantial for Lutherans, United Methodists, the United Church of Christ, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, and Disciples of Christ. Together, these six denominations lost nearly 23 million members—almost the same number that was gained by such conservative Protestant denominations as the Southern Baptists, the Church of the Nazarene, the Seventh-Day Adventists, the Assemblies of God, the Church of God, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Between 1990 and 2008, the four largest mainline denominations—Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and Episcopalians—lost an additional 4 million members, a decline of 13 percent from 1990 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2012b). At the same time, Black Protestant churches have thrived in the United States, as their members move into the middle class and achieve economic and political prominence (Finke and Stark, 2005; Roof and McKinney, 1990).</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_677" title="677"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Catholicism</b> Catholics make up about a fifth of the U.S. population. The number of Catholics appears to be declining, in part because more people are leaving Catholicism for another faith than are joining the Church: Of the nearly one-third of Americans who were born Catholic, 41 percent no longer identify with the Catholic Church (Pew Research Center, 2015c). Church attendance among Catholics has also declined. In 1975, 47 percent of Catholics reported attending Mass at least once a week. By 2017, that figure had dropped to 39 percent (Saad, 2018). While church attendance has declined for Catholics of all ages, the drop has been sharpest for young Catholics (ages 18 to 29); currently, only about 30 percent of young Catholics attend church every week. A 2018 Gallup Poll found that 25 percent of young Catholics (21–29 years of age) attended church in the last 7 days. While the reasons for such declines are unclear, one reason likely has to do with the 1968 papal encyclical <i class="italic">Of Human Life</i> (<i class="italic">Humane Vitae</i>), which reaffirmed the ban on all forms of artificial contraception by Catholics. People whose conscience allowed for the use of contraceptives were faced with disobeying the Church, and many did just that. According to a 2015 Pew survey, three-quarters (76 percent) of U.S. Catholics say the Church should allow the use of birth control (Pew Research Center, 2015d).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Other Religious Groups</b> Judaism in the United States has historically been divided into three major movements: Orthodox Judaism, which believes in the divine origins of the Jewish Bible (as previously noted, called the Old Testament by Christians) and follows highly traditional religious practices; Conservative Judaism, which is a blend of traditional and more contemporary beliefs and practices; and Reform Judaism, which rejects most traditional practices and is progressive in its ritual practices (services, for example, are more likely to be conducted in English than in Hebrew). Both Conservative and Reform Judaism reflect efforts by Jewish immigrants (or their descendants) to develop beliefs and rituals that turned away from “Old World” ones, developing forms more consistent with their new homeland. Reform Judaism is the largest Jewish denominational movement in the United States, comprising 38 percent of all American Jews (Berkley Center, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Despite (or perhaps partly because of) these efforts to modernize Judaism, the number of Jews in the United States has declined as a result of low birthrates, intermarriage, and assimilation. According to a 2016 Gallup Poll survey, the percent of U.S. adults who identify as Jewish has declined from about 10 percent of the U.S. population to about 2 percent since the late 1950s. Intermarriage rates are also on the rise; nearly 60 percent of Jews who have gotten married since 2000 have a non-Jewish spouse (Pew Research Center, 2013a). Estimates of the number of Jewish Americans in the United States today vary widely, which may reflect precisely how Jews are identified and counted. Some Americans identify as Jewish if they have a Jewish mother—even if they have never practiced their religion. Some may self-identify as Jewish only if they participate actively in the religion, whereas others still may identify as “culturally Jewish,” meaning they celebrate their heritage and culture but do not actively practice the religion. Survey data from the Pew Research Center reports that in 2014, just 1.9 percent of the U.S. population was Jewish (Pew Research Center, 2015c). This percent has not changed as of 2020 (CIA, 2020c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Among Muslims, growing emigration from Asia and Africa may change the U.S. religious profile. CIA World Factbook estimates that in 2015, there were approximately <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_678" title="678"></span>2.9 million Muslims in the United States, accounting for almost 1 percent of the population (CIA, 2020c). It is projected that this share will double by 2050 (Mohamed, 2016). A majority of Muslim Americans are first-generation immigrants to the United States (63 percent), with many coming from the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa (Lipka, 2017).</p>
