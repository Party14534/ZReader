<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_5">Going Beyond Purely Economic Measures of Global Well-Being</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are, however, a number of problems in using the World Bank income categories as measures of success. One problem is that using average income masks income inequality <i class="italic">within</i> each country. The average incomes for each economy, on which these data are based, are skewed upward when a relatively small portion of the population has extremely high incomes. China, for example, has raised several hundred million people <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_294" title="294"></span>out of poverty into middle-class status and, as we have seen, has many billionaires—yet China still has hundreds of millions of impoverished peasants. In contrast, the United States is in the upper ranks of high-income countries, with an average income in 2018 of $63,080 (World Bank, 2019d); yet the United States has more than a half million homeless people on any given day (Henry et al., 2018), and some 38 million people living in poverty (Fontenot et al., 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This raises a second problem: Comparing countries on the basis of economic output alone may be misleading because GNI includes only goods and services produced for cash sale that are known to the government. Many people in low-income countries produce only for their own families or for barter, which involves noncash transactions. The value of their crops and animals is not reflected in the official statistics. The economy also includes paid work that is done “off the books”—the gardener or housekeeper who is paid by cash or check with no official records kept; the street vendor; illegal activities of all sorts. While this so-called informal sector is found in all countries, it is especially prevalent in poorer countries, where it may make an important contribution to the overall economy. According to a UN International Labour Organization estimate, as many as 60 percent of all workers in the world engage in some type of informal work, most of them in poorer countries (ILO, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A third problem with classifying countries on the basis of income alone is that it can be misleading, since it obscures the difference between absolute and relative poverty. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-absolute-poverty" href="part0060_split_006.html#absolute-poverty">Absolute poverty</a> occurs when persons cannot acquire basic life needs, including food, clothing, and shelter; starvation is often a way of life for those in this category. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-relative-poverty" href="part0060_split_006.html#relative-poverty">Relative poverty</a> occurs when persons are poor relative to others in their society; they may struggle to make ends meet while their neighbors can more easily put food on the table or pay the rent. Most poverty in the United States is relative poverty; most of the poor are not starving or homeless, and even homeless people are often able to find shelters and food kitchens. By way of contrast, almost everyone in the African country of Burundi, where an average income in 2018 of $280 makes it the poorest country in the world, lives in absolute poverty. In Burundi, half of the population is chronically hungry and agricultural production is too poor to meet the country’s needs (World Food Programme, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Finally, economic output is not a country’s whole story, since it fails to adequately capture important non-economic aspects of people’s lives. The United Nations Human Development Program has developed a Multidimensional Poverty Index (MDPI) that combines 10 poverty-related indicators into a single weighted index, intended to provide a measure of <i class="italic">human development</i> rather than economic development alone. The indicators are grouped into three major categories that provide a broad picture of one’s quality of life: <i class="italic">health</i> (nutrition, child mortality), <i class="italic">education</i> (years of schooling, school attendance), and <i class="italic">standard of living</i> (materials used as cooking fuel, household sanitation, access to potable drinking water, household electricity, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_295" title="295"></span>adequately constructed housing, possession of such basic assets as a bicycle or refrigerator) (UNDP, 2019b). Based on this measure, the UN estimates that 1.3 billion people around the world live in poverty, twice the number as measured by income alone. The much higher numbers reflect aspects of poverty that are missed by purely economic indicators: the fact that more than a quarter of a billion children do not attend primary or secondary school, or 5.4 million children die before they reach the age of five (UNDP, 2019b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This effort to measure aspects of human development, beyond purely economic growth, reflects a proposal first made by the Nobel Prize–winning Indian economist/philosopher Amartya Sen. Forty years ago, Sen argued that instead of focusing on purely economic indicators, what is important is the quality of life people are capable of achieving—the freedom to make fundamental life choices. Sen argued that indicators of such freedom were preferable to measures of income or wealth, since they reflected the capability people have to achieve the quality of life they prefer (Sen, 1979). Governments should be assessed not in terms of such measures as the average income of their country, but rather in terms of what their citizens are capable of achieving, given the public and private opportunities that are provided. For this reason, Sen’s approach is termed the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-capabilities-approach" href="part0060_split_006.html#capabilities-approach">Capabilities Approach</a>, since it emphasizes the degree to which people are capable of achieving a life they value, given the opportunities they face.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sen’s ideas (and efforts) shaped the United Nations’ <i class="italic">Human Development Report</i>, an annual publication (first launched in 1990) that ranks countries on numerous social as well as economic indicators. The most recent <i class="italic">Report</i>, for example, distinguishes access to what it terms <i class="italic">basic capabilities</i> (early childhood survival, primary education, entry-level technologies, the ability to withstand minor life setbacks) from <i class="italic">more advanced capabilities</i> (high-quality health care and education, present-day technologies, the ability to withstand major life setbacks). This approach emphasizes the importance of the kinds of measures that sociologists, rather than economists, are likely to be concerned with. It has led the UN to some startling conclusions that are not evident from economic data alone (UNDP, 2019b):</p>
<ul class="contents">
<li class="bcpt"><span>Although there has been success in raising incomes worldwide, such things as lack of basic schooling, infant mortality, and starvation remain global problems.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>While differences in <i class="italic">basic capabilities</i> have declined, a “new generation” of differences in <i class="italic">enhanced capabilities</i> is emerging; lack of access to high-quality education or technology will prove a barrier to those who are left behind in the years to come.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>Inequalities accumulate through life, often reflecting deep power imbalances: Where people lack power, they lack the ability to shape the institutions—from education to health care to jobs—that will affect the life prospects of their children.</span></li>
