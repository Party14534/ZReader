<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">The Global South</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As previously mentioned, the majority of countries in the global south—South Asia, Africa, and South America—are in areas that underwent colonial rule. A few colonized areas gained independence early, such as Haiti, which became the first autonomous Black republic in 1804. The Spanish colonies in South America acquired their freedom in 1810, while Brazil broke away from Portuguese rule in 1822.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some countries that were never ruled from Europe were nonetheless strongly influenced by colonial relationships. China, for example, was compelled from the seventeenth century on to enter into trading agreements with European powers, which assumed government control over certain areas, including major seaports. Hong Kong was the last of these. Most nations in the global south have become independent states only since World War II, often following bloody anticolonial struggles. Examples include India, which shortly after achieving self-rule split into India and Pakistan; a range of other Asian countries (such as Malaysia, Myanmar, and Singapore); and countries in Africa (such as Algeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although they may include peoples living in traditional fashion, these countries differ from earlier forms of traditional society. Their political systems, following Western models, make them nation-states. Although most of the population still lives in rural areas, a rapid process of city development is occurring. Although agriculture remains the main economic activity, many crops are produced for sale in world markets. These countries are not merely societies that have somehow “lagged behind” the more industrialized areas; they emerged from contact with Western industrialism, which has undermined the more traditional systems.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The World Bank estimates that 736 million people, or nearly 10 percent of the world’s population, are living in extreme poverty, which is defined as subsisting on $1.90 or less per day (World Bank, 2018a). Furthermore, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Association also estimates that as of 2018, an estimated 820 million people worldwide experienced hunger, and upwards of 2 billion people experienced food insecurity (UN Food and Agriculture Association, 2019b). Almost all of these people live in the global south and half live in sub-Saharan Africa. A third of the world’s poor and hungry live in South Asia, in <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_76" title="76"></span>countries such as India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Bangladesh (World Bank, 2018a). China, however, has made great strides; some 850 million people were lifted out of poverty between 1990 and 2019 (World Bank, 2019k). A substantial number of the poor—some 25.9 million people—live on the doorstep of the United States, in the Caribbean and Central and South America (World Bank, 2018a). Despite progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which call for ending poverty by 2030, major challenges still remain, particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the world’s poor live. The global economic crisis in 2008 had an acutely destructive impact on people living in poverty, particularly women (UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, 2010). Most of the gains in reducing global poverty and hunger have resulted from economic growth in China and East Asia.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Global poverty shouldn’t be seen as remote from the concerns of Americans. Whereas in previous generations, the bulk of immigrants to the United States came from European countries, recent years have seen waves of Hispanic immigrants, nearly all from Latin America. Some U.S. cities, such as Los Angeles and Miami, have become international gateways to Latin America and are bursting with new immigrants who maintain trading connections with their home countries.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In most societies, poverty is worst in rural areas. Malnutrition, lack of education, low life expectancy, and substandard housing are most severe in the countryside, especially where arable land is scarce, agricultural productivity low, and drought or floods common. Women are usually more disadvantaged than men. For instance, they often work longer hours and, when paid at all, earn lower wages. (See <a href="part0065_split_000.html#1TVKI0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 10</a> for a lengthier discussion of gender inequality.)</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The poor in the global south live in conditions almost unimaginable to North Americans. Many have no permanent dwellings apart from shelters made of cartons or loose pieces of wood. Most have no running water, sewage systems, or electricity. Nonetheless, millions of poor people also live in the United States, and there are connections between poverty in America and global poverty. This is true of the descendants of the Black slaves brought over by force centuries ago, and it is true of more recent, and willing, immigrants who have arrived from Latin America, Asia, and elsewhere. Although immigrants and their children make up only 13 percent of the U.S. population, they account for a quarter of all those living in poverty in the United States (Center for Immigration Studies, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some formerly impoverished countries have successfully embarked on a process of industrialization. Referred to as the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-emerging-economies" href="part0025_split_003.html#emerging-economies">emerging economies</a>, they include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, India, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. The rates of economic growth of the most successful countries, such as those in East Asia, are several times those of the Western industrial economies.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The East Asian emerging economies are investing abroad as well as promoting growth at home. China is investing in mines and factories in Africa, elsewhere in East Asia, and in Latin America. South Korea’s production of steel has increased by nearly 50 percent in the last decade, and its shipbuilding and electronics industries are among the world’s leaders (World Steel Association, 2013). Singapore is becoming the major financial and commercial center of Southeast Asia. Taiwan is an important presence in the manufacturing and electronics industries. All these changes have directly affected the United <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_77" title="77"></span>States. In fact, the “rise of the rest” (Zakaria, 2009) is arguably the most important aspect of global economic change in the world today.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is worth noting that a country’s economic growth does not necessarily mean that its citizens are happier or feel more secure. A growing body of research suggests the opposite: As countries industrialize, their general sense of well-being does not increase and may even decline. Even in China, despite unprecedented rates of economic growth that have elevated hundreds of millions of Chinese into middle-class status, the most recent research suggests that people’s happiness—at least as measured on a “life satisfaction” index—is actually lower than it was two decades ago, before China’s “growth miracle” took off (Easterlin, 2001, 2003, 2010; Easterlin and Sawangfa, 2010; Easterlin et al., 2010, 2012; Inglehart, 1997).</p>
