<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">The Third Generation of Theories: Life Course</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-life-course" href="part0079_split_004.html#life-course">Life course</a> theorists reject what they regard as the one-sided emphases of both functionalism and conflict theories, where older adults are viewed either as merely adapting to the larger society (functionalism) or as victims of the stratification system (social conflict). Rather, life course theorists view older persons as playing an active role in determining their own physical and mental well-being, yet recognize the constraints imposed by social structural factors.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to the life course perspective, the aging process is shaped by historical time and place; factors such as wars, economic shifts, the development of new technologies, and the emergence of new infectious diseases like COVID-19 shape how people age. Yet this perspective also emphasizes agency, where individuals make choices that reflect both the opportunities and the constraints facing them. The most important theme of the life course perspective is that aging is a lifelong process; relationships, events, and experiences of early life have consequences for later life.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_430" title="430"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Mounting research shows that our physical and mental health in later life is closely linked to the advantages and disadvantages we faced early in life, dating back as far as childhood and infancy. People who begin life in a position of social advantage generally are better positioned to acquire additional resources than those who begin life at the bottom of the stratification system. Those born into well-off families enjoy richer economic resources, better health, and more educational opportunities in early life—all of which set the stage for rewarding jobs, good health, and emotional well-being in later life.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Those with adversities earlier in life, like Alice Garvin, who we introduced earlier in this chapter, often are denied access to the opportunities that ensure a happy and healthy old age. Researchers have found that childhood and adolescent experiences—including parental death (Slavich, Monroe, and Gotlib, 2011), parental divorce (Amato, 2000), child-abuse victimization (Slopen et al., 2010), poverty (Duncan, Ziol-Guest, and Kalil, 2010), and living in an unsafe neighborhood (Vartanian and Houser, 2010)—have harmful implications for health among older adults. Often, these early adversities put young people at risk of poor health behaviors, economic strains, marital troubles, and other difficulties in young adulthood that may contribute to lifelong health problems (Carr, 2019). In other words, adversities in early life give rise to various challenges in adulthood, which accumulate to make the aging process very difficult for the disadvantaged.</p>
