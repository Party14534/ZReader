<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Imagine standing before a clock that measures time on a cosmic scale, in which each second represents 60,000 years. On such a clock, it would take 24 hours for the 5-billion-year history of our planet to unfold. Humanlike apes would not even appear <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_820" title="820"></span>until the last two minutes, and human beings only in the last four seconds. Compared to us, even the dinosaurs would look like long-term residents of the planet; they roamed the earth for nearly three-quarters of an hour on our 24-hour clock, before disappearing forever. Will human beings—whose great civilizations appeared only in the last quarter second—do nearly as well?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Human beings are very recent residents of planet Earth, yet we have unquestionably made our presence known. Our numbers have exploded to some 7.6 billion people and will probably reach 9 billion to 10 billion by 2050. We have spread to every nook and cranny on the planet. Thanks to modern science and industry, each of us uses up a vastly greater amount of the planet’s limited resources than did our apelike ancestors. Indeed, the combination of population explosion and modern industrial expansion threatens both our planet and human civilization.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Humans have demonstrated a unique ability to create massive problems—and then find ways to solve them. Today our problems are global, requiring global solutions. Globalization has contributed to such challenges as global warming and climate change, the worldwide spread of HIV/AIDS, as well as conflict among nations, terrorism, and global poverty. Yet globalization can also contribute to their solution. All human beings share a common home and, therefore, a common interest in its preservation.</p>
