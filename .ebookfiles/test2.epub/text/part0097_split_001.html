<dd role="definition" id="family" aria-labelledby="keyterm-family" class="calibre11">A group of individuals related to one another by blood ties, marriage, or adoption, who form an economic unit, the adult members of which are responsible for the upbringing of children.

<dd role="definition" id="kinship" aria-labelledby="keyterm-kinship" class="calibre11">A relation that links individuals through blood ties, marriage, or adoption.

<dd role="definition" id="marriage" aria-labelledby="keyterm-marriage" class="calibre11">A socially approved sexual relationship between two individuals.
