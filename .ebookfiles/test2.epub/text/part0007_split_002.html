<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Every chapter in the Twelfth Seagull Edition follows the same structure, making it easier for students to study. Each chapter opens with an attention-grabbing question that challenges students’ misconceptions about the topic.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Each chapter is broken down into four sections:</p>
<ol class="fmnl">
<li class="bcpt" value="1">Basic concepts</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="2">Important theories</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="3">Current research</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="4">Unanswered questions</li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">At the end of each section, students have the opportunity to test themselves with integrated “Concept Check” quizzes. The Twelfth Seagull Edition also features “Big Picture” concept maps <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_xviii" title="xviii"></span>that integrate the learning objectives, key terms, “Concept Checks,” and “Thinking Sociologically” activities into a handy one-stop review tool at the end of each chapter.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The chapters follow a sequence designed to help students achieve a progressive mastery of the different fields of sociology, but we have taken care to ensure that the book can be used flexibly and will be easy to adapt to the needs of individual courses. Chapters can be deleted or studied in a different order without much loss. Each has been written as a fairly autonomous unit, with cross-referencing to other chapters at relevant points.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In this edition, racial and ethnic categorizations are considered proper nouns and thus are capitalized. As Temple University journalism professor Lori Tharps notes, “Black with a capital B refers to people of the African diaspora. Lowercase black is simply a color” (Tharps, 2014). In the same way, “White” as a racial category acknowledges the functions of this label in society. Racial designations are not neutral markers of skin tone, but socially constructed categories whose meanings and boundaries shift over time and place. Treating these categories as proper nouns recognizes them as such (Appiah, 2020).</p>
