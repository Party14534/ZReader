<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">How Does Gender Inequality Affect Men?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Discussions of gender inequality typically focus on women, given stark and persistent gender gaps in earnings and women’s much higher rates of sexual victimization relative to men, as we will discuss next. Yet traditional gender role beliefs and practices exert a profound toll on men as well, undermining the quality of their personal relationships, their freedom to choose professions that mesh with their own interests, their physical and mental health, and, ultimately, their life spans. Pressures for men to abide by the expectations of hegemonic masculinity—or the cultural beliefs that men should be strong, forceful, and independent—also are linked with men’s much higher rates of aggressive behavior, where men both perpetuate and are the victims of physical violence.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For instance, as we saw in <a href="part0046_split_000.html#1BRPS0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 7</a>, men make up the vast majority of persons arrested for violent crimes. Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) show that men account for 98 percent of all arrests for forcible rape, 90 percent of those <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_366" title="366"></span>arrested for robbery, and 80 to 85 percent of those arrested for vandalism, arson, and motor vehicle theft. Given that aggression begets retaliative aggression, men also are more likely than women to die of a range of violent causes. For instance, men make up more than 90 percent of all drug- and gang-related homicides (FBI, 2016b). Men, especially young men, also are more likely than women to die from risky and reckless behaviors, including motor vehicle deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2017c).</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">On average, women live about five years longer than men. This gender gap in life expectancy is due in part to the fact that traditional ideas about masculinity keep men from engaging in preventative health care such as getting a flu shot.</figcaption>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Men also are more likely than women to die of suicide, at every point in the life course; as <a href="part0115_split_000.html#3DLGM0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 18</a> will show, women are more likely than men to become depressed, but they are also more likely to turn to others for support and, as a result, are less likely to turn to a violent act like killing themselves. Men also tend to die younger than women; this partly reflects the fact that men, especially those who cling tightly to traditional notions about masculinity, are less likely to go to the doctor for regular checkups, or seek medical attention—acts which might be considered signs of vulnerability or weakness (Springer and Mouzon, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Adherence to traditional gender-typed behaviors and attitudes affects men’s daily lives in far less dramatic ways. Men, especially men raised in the mid-twentieth century, often found that their career choices were constrained by the need to be a family’s main breadwinner. One study of men and women who graduated Wisconsin high schools in 1957 found that by the time the men reached their thirties, they had abandoned any hopes of pursuing careers that they found personally rewarding, instead focusing on jobs that paid the bills (Carr, 2005). For instance, one man recounted that he could not pursue his dream of starting his own used car business because it was too risky for a sole breadwinner. Ed explained: ”I had a wife and three kids, so it’s pretty hard to make a career change without some sort of guarantee. And you don’t get any guarantee in sales.” Other men explicitly noted that they felt trapped in jobs they found blatantly unpleasant. Bob, a stock handler at a warehouse, described his job: “I couldn’t stand it. It was so repetitious, the same thing every day. I knew I was going nowhere, and I couldn’t do much about it. You have to just keep on working and keep up with the obligations day to day.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Constraints of the “good provider” role not only limited men’s ability to leave undesirable jobs and pursue their personal career goals; these pressures also kept them from being as involved in child care as they would have liked. Nearly every father interviewed in the study said that his work responsibilities impeded the development of close family relationships. Al, a farm foreman with four children, recalled, “When we first bought [our] house, I worked a [second] part-time job. I used to work until 5, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_367" title="367"></span>and I’d come home, grab lunch, and then I worked for a contractor driving trucks until 10 at night. When the kids were 6 and 7, I didn’t have much home life with them. I look back now and I wish I had spent more time with them. But, I wanted to get the house paid off.” Don, a heavy machinery mechanic at a paper mill, regretted that he regularly worked nights and weekends. He explained, “I had four children and changing jobs wasn’t an option. . . . The [long] hours I put in helped the family out. But everything has a price. I would have liked to have been with my family more. All four kids now have good educations and good homes in good neighborhoods. I just wish that I could have been around more when they were little” (Carr, 2005).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The pressure on men to make sacrifices so that they can provide for their families takes a long- and short-term toll on their personal relationships. At every age, from childhood to later life, children report more close-knit and supportive relationships with their mothers than their fathers (Rossi and Rossi, 1990). Fathers’ more tenuous ties with their children dissolve even further upon divorce (e.g., Kalmijn, 2013), creating a situation whereby older unmarried men have few sources of support in later life (Steptoe et al., 2013). For these reasons, the call for gender equality does not benefit women only; rather, equal opportunities for men and women are critical for the health, well-being, and quality of life for all.</p>
