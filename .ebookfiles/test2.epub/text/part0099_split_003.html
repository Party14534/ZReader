<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Family Formation and Dissolution Trends in the Contemporary United States</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Given the ethnic, racial, and cultural diversity of the United States, there are considerable variations in family and marriage within our country. Most research on families in the United States compares broad racial groups as defined by the U.S. Census: White, Black, Asian, and Native American, as well as persons with Hispanic ethnicity, regardless of race (see <a href="part0071_split_000.html#23MNU0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 11</a>). However, as we shall see below, intermarriage, or marriage between two persons of different racial backgrounds, has grown increasingly common over the past two decades. Most research shows quite striking differences in the marriage and childbearing patterns of White and U.S.-born Black families; Asian American families resemble Whites in many ways, while patterns among persons of Hispanic-origin and Black immigrants are highly varied based on their particular culture or country of origin. These differences reflect long-standing economic and historical factors that shape family formation. After considering these differences, we <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_580" title="580"></span>will examine divorce, remarriage, stepparenting, and childbearing in relation to contemporary patterns of family life.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The United States has long had high marriage rates; nearly 90 percent of adults in their mid-fifties and early sixties today are married or have previously been married (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2017b). However, recent evidence shows that the age at which Americans marry for the first time has risen sharply in recent decades, leading researchers to debate whether marriage is simply being delayed or is being forgone all together. In 2019, the median age at first marriage in the United States was 28 for women and 29.8 for men; this marks a dramatic increase from 1960, when the median ages were 20.3 and 22.8, respectively (see Figure 15.1) (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2019d). Sociologists offer several explanations for this trend.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">First, some researchers contend that increases in cohabitation among younger people account for the decrease (or delay) in marriage among this group. In past decades, young people who wanted to live with their romantic partner typically got married, given the stigma associated with “living in sin” and having sexual relations with a person to whom one was not legally married. Within the past four decades, however, cohabitation has grown exponentially in popularity among young adults, alongside the disappearing stigma of premarital sexual relations. Cohabitation is also increasingly popular among older adults, and nonmarital cohabitation is replacing remarriage as the main way that midlife and older adults repartner following divorce (Brown and Wright, 2017). In 2007, the Current Population Survey (CPS), a national survey of U.S. adults, introduced a measure that identifies all cohabiting partners in a household (Kennedy and Fitch, 2012). Because the practice and formal measurement of cohabitation is relatively new, it is not easy to make direct comparisons with much earlier time periods. Nonetheless, we can estimate that the number of younger-age couples who have ever lived together without being married has risen steeply from half a million couples around 1970 to almost 3 million in 1990. By 2016, more than 8 million couples were cohabiting in the United States (U.S. Bureau of the Census, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_581" title="581"></span>2017h). Among young adults ages 18–24, cohabitation is now more common than living with a spouse: 9 percent lived with an unmarried partner in 2018, compared to 7 percent who lived with a spouse (Gurrentz, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Others argue that increases in postsecondary school enrollment, especially among women, are partially responsible. Most couples prefer to delay marriage until they have completed their formal schooling (Wang and Parker, 2014). That’s part of the reason why marriage has become an institution of social and economic advantage; young adults with higher levels of education and income are more likely than those with fewer economic advantages to transition from cohabitation to marriage (Gurrentz, 2018). Not only does it cost money to have a wedding, but young people believe that economic security is a prerequisite for marrying and may wait until they graduate, find a secure job, and pay off college loans (Sassler, Michelmore, and Qian, 2018). Similarly, women’s increased participation in the labor force means many women establish careers before getting married and starting a family (Copen et al., 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Finally, some researchers believe that modernization and a secular change in attitudes promote individualism and downplay the importance of marriage. According to this perspective, young people are not just delaying marriage but may forgo marriage altogether. As we will see later in this chapter, cohabitation has surpassed marriage in popularity in some Western and Northern European nations. Sociologists do not predict a parallel trend in the United States, where well over half of unmarried young adults say that they do want to marry someday (Wang and Parker, 2014). However, according to Census Bureau predictions, a sizeable proportion of Generation Y and Millennials will remain unmarried for life, with this pattern especially common among those with fewer financial advantages (Wang and Parker, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The actual reason for the delay in marriage and accompanying decline in marriage rates is likely a combination of economic, social, and cultural factors. Still, we must be careful in drawing the conclusion that Americans are turning their back on marriage. Although some social critics have argued that the trend toward marriage later in life is a break from tradition, the age of first marriage in the United States is now more similar to what it was between 1890 and 1940 and departs markedly only from the very low ages of first marriage in the mid-twentieth century. In 1890, the median age at first marriage for men was 26, lower than the median age of 30 today, but still a far cry from the 1950s, when marriage happened in one’s very early twenties (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2017i). To say that people today are postponing marriage dramatically is true only if we compare ourselves with Americans in the 1950s. It might be more accurate to say that the 1950s generation married at an unusually young age.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">No one knows how the trend toward cohabitation will develop in the future, but we can get useful information from other industrial countries. In France, Sweden, and other nations where cohabitation is as widespread as marriage, many people, especially younger adults, view the two as interchangeable (Treas et al., 2014). By contrast, in the United States, only two-thirds of those cohabiting say that their relationship is a precursor to marriage (Pew Research Center, 2011d). And plans to marry don’t always lead to a walk down the aisle; sociologist Karen Guzzo (2009) found that one-quarter of cohabitors who were engaged or planned to marry ended up changing their minds or ending their unions. We return to the topic of cohabitation as an alternative to marriage later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">An extraordinary increase in the proportion of people living alone in the United States has taken place recently—a phenomenon that partly reflects the high levels of <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_582" title="582"></span>marital separation and divorce. More than one in every four households (28 percent) in 2016 consisted of one person, more than twice the proportion (13.1 percent) in 1960 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2017e). There has been a particularly sharp rise for individuals living alone in the 24 to 44 age bracket.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we noted in this chapter’s introduction, some people still think the “average” American family consists of a husband who works in paid employment and a wife who looks after the home and their two children. However, less than a quarter of married couples with children under 15 fit this picture (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2016b). One reason is the high and stable divorce rate: A substantial proportion of the population lives either in single-parent households or in stepfamilies, or both. Another is the high proportion of women who work. Dual-career marriages and single-parent families are now the norm. Although men historically were the only breadwinner or the higher earner in the marriage, this pattern is rapidly changing; women outearn their husbands in 29 percent of households today (Bureau of the Census, 2019b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are also significant differences in patterns of childbearing between parents in the 1950s and later generations. The birth rate rose sharply just after World War II and again during the 1950s. Women in the 1950s had their first child earlier than later generations did, and subsequent children were born closer together. Since the late 1960s, the average age at which women have their first child has risen steadily. In 2015, the average age of first-time moms was 26.4, up from 22.1 in 1970. The proportion of women giving birth in their 30s and 40s also has increased sharply. In 1976, only 20 percent of births were to women over age 30. By 2015, this proportion had grown to 44 percent (Martin et al., 2017). Specifically, the first birth rates for women between the ages of 35 and 39 have increased dramatically since the early 1970s, jumping more than six-fold (Mathews and Hamilton, 2014). Delayed childbearing, like delayed marriage, is due largely to rising levels of education and greater career opportunities for women today, relative to five decades ago.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Family structures and patterns are powerfully shaped by both structural and cultural factors. Structural factors—including shifts in educational attainment, economic prospects of young adults, widening levels of income inequality, and whether one has the legal right to marry—have a powerful influence on the ways families are formed. At the same time, cultural factors, ranging from attitudes toward marriage, sexuality, and cohabitation to beliefs about the appropriate context for raising children, shape family lives. For these reasons, American families vary widely based on factors such as social class, race, ethnicity, religion, and even the geographic region where one lives. We briefly focus on the ways that race and social class shape family life in the contemporary United States.</p>
<section id="race-ethnicity-and-american-families">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Race, Ethnicity, and American Families</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists have documented stark differences in family structure among White, Black, Native American, Asian, and Hispanic-origin families. Early studies failed to consider distinctions between race and ethnicity, lumping together, for instance, U.S.-born and non-U.S.-born Blacks, and attributed Black-White differences in family structure to “cultural” differences, including beliefs about the importance of marriage and about the importance of being economically self-sufficient (Lewis, 1969). However, in recent decades, scholars have moved away from “cultural” approaches and instead recognize the critical importance of structural factors, recognizing that socioeconomic resources, including education, the opportunity to work in jobs that <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_583" title="583"></span>provide a living wage and enable people to amass savings, are among the key factors that contribute to differences in family structure—most notably, the greater tendency of Whites and Asians (relative to Blacks, Hispanic-origin persons, and Native Americans) to marry, to remain married, and to have children within marriage. However, as we have seen elsewhere in this book, race and socioeconomic status are so closely intertwined in the United States that it is difficult to parse the distinctive effects of one over the other. Another advance in recent years is attention to multiracial families; younger cohorts are far more likely than their parents to date and marry persons of a different race. One in six recent newlyweds married persons of a race different from theirs, shedding light on the increasingly complex ways that race shapes family experiences in the United States (Livingston and Brown, 2017).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Native American Families</b> Kinship ties are very important in Native American families. As family scholar Andrew Cherlin (1999) notes, “Kinship networks constitute tribal organization; kinship ties confer identity” for Native Americans. However, for those who live in cities or away from reservations, kinship ties may be less prominent. Furthermore, Native Americans have higher rates of intermarriage than any other racial or ethnic group. According to 2013 American Community Survey data, fully 58 percent of all newlywed Native Americans married non-natives. By way of comparison, just 11 percent of Whites, 18 percent of Blacks, 29 percent of Asians and 27 percent of Hispanics who married in 2015 wed a partner of a different racial background (Bialik, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Native American women have a low overall birth rate, but a high percentage of these births occur outside of marriage. At 9.7 babies per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44, it <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_584" title="584"></span>was the lowest of any ethnic group in the United States in 2015, a drastic change from 25 years ago, when the 1990 birth rate of Native American women was 19 per 1,000 women—one of the highest rates in the United States (Martin et al., 2017). However, compared to all U.S. women, a high proportion of Native American births were to women under age 20 (11 percent compared to 6 percent for women of all ethnicities). Native American women also have their first children at a younger age; as a group, they have the youngest mean age at first birth at just over 23. Furthermore, nearly 66 percent of all Native American women giving birth in 2015 were not married (Martin et al., 2017). Sandefur and Liebler (1997) also report a high divorce rate for Native Americans, who, in addition, are at particularly high risk of domestic violence. Yet, as we will see later in this chapter, family violence can afflict persons of any ethnicity (T. Williams, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Hispanic and Latinx-Origin Families</b> Persons of Hispanic and Latinx origin vary widely with respect to culture, history, and socioeconomic status, and consequently also are heterogeneous when it comes to family patterns. Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans are three of the largest Hispanic subgroups. In 2017, Mexicans constituted 62 percent of the Hispanic population, Puerto Ricans constituted 10 percent, and Cubans were just 4 percent; the rest of the Hispanic population was made up of much smaller groups from many Latin American nations (Noe-Bustamante, Flores, and Shah, 2019b, 2019c, 2019a). Overall, recent cohorts of Latinx persons are among the most likely of all ethnic groups to marry someone of a different ethnicity. In 2015, fully 27 percent of Hispanic-origin persons (regardless of ethnicity) married someone who does not identify as Hispanic origin, with men and women equally likely to out-marry.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">Like many Mexican American families, the Camargo household contains multiple generations, including Beatriz Camargo and her husband and three kids, Beatriz’s parents, two brothers, and her sister.</figcaption>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Mexican American families often live in multigenerational households and have a high birth rate. Economically, Mexican American families are more successful than Puerto Rican families but less so than Cuban families. Defying cultural stereotypes of a Mexican American home with a male breadwinner and female homemaker, almost 60 percent of all Mexican American women are in the labor force (BLS, 2020b). However, this situation is due to necessity rather than desire. Many Mexican American families would prefer the breadwinner-homemaker model but are constrained by finances (Hurtado, 1995).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Family members from Mexico and other Central American nations, including Guatemala and El Salvador, often must grapple with separation from one another. Often, family members will migrate to the United States sequentially, where one person (usually the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_585" title="585"></span>father) secures a job and sends money, or “remittances,” back to his family. The plans for the rest of the family to move to the United States and reunite are often delayed or halted due to immigration laws (Smokowski and Bacallao, 2011). Even after family members arrive, those who are undocumented may risk deportation, again causing family separation (Chang-Muy, 2009). Undocumented families have faced particular uncertainty and turmoil under the Trump administration; during just a two-month period in 2019, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) removed roughly 1,000 migrant children from their families, often for reasons as minor as a parent having a traffic citation (Jordan, 2019). The short- and long-term effects of separation and parental deportation for a child’s emotional, physical, and cognitive well-being are dire (Allen, Cisneros, and Tellez, 2013; Capps et al., 2007).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The case is very different for Puerto Ricans, because Puerto Rico is a U.S. commonwealth. Because of their status as U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans move freely between Puerto Rico and the mainland without the difficulties immigrants encounter. When barriers to immigration are high, only the most able (physically, financially, and so on) members of a society can move to another country; because Puerto Ricans face fewer barriers, even the least able can manage the migration process. Thus, they are the most economically disadvantaged of all the major Hispanic groups in the United States. Puerto Rican families have a higher percentage of children born to unmarried mothers than any other Hispanic group—69.2 percent in 2018 (CDC, 2019). Only African Americans (71 percent) and Native Americans (66 percent) have higher rates of births to unmarried women (Martin et al., 2017). However, consensual unions—cohabiting relationships in which couples consider themselves married but are not legally married—are often the context for births to unmarried mothers. Nancy Landale and Kelly Fennelly (1992) studied the marital experiences of Puerto Rican women and found that many lived in consensual unions. They suggest that Puerto Ricans may respond to tough economic times by forming consensual unions as the next best option to a more expensive legal marriage.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Cuban American families are the most prosperous of all the Hispanic groups but are less prosperous than Whites. Cuban Americans historically have settled in the Miami area, forming enclaves in which they rely on other Cubans for their business and social needs (such as banking, schools, and shopping). The relative wealth of Cuban Americans is driven largely by family business ownership. In terms of childbearing, Cuban Americans have lower levels of fertility than non-Hispanic Whites and equally low levels of nonmarital fertility, suggesting that economic factors are equally if not more important than cultural factors in shaping family lives in the United States.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Black Families</b> Black Americans are a diverse group, including those who have lived in the United States for generations, as well as more recent migrants from Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America (Anderson, 2015). Most of what we know about Black families in the contemporary United States is based on U.S.-born Blacks whose family lives have been shaped by the legacy of slavery (Wilson, 1987). However, in recent years scholars have pointed out stark differences in the marriage and family formation patterns of U.S.-born versus immigrant Blacks. We highlight several examples later in this section, to reveal how race, migration, culture and economic factors shape the family experiences of Americans.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">U.S.-born Black and White families differ dramatically in terms of family structure, although these differences are largely attributable to structural factors, including economic resources that facilitate marriage and marital stability. Blacks have higher rates of childbearing outside marriage, are less likely ever to marry, and are less likely to marry after having a nonmarital birth (Figure 15.3). These differences are of particular interest to sociologists because single parenthood in the United States is both a cause and consequence of poverty (Harknett and McLanahan, 2004).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The contemporary state of U.S.-born Black families has deep historical roots. One of the first sociological analyses was carried out by E. Franklin Frazier, in his 1939 book <i class="italic">The Negro Family in the United States</i>. Frazier examined how historical factors such as slavery, racism, urban migration, and economic adversities affected families. Frazier’s work has been critiqued by feminist scholars, among others, who believe he subtly blames problems facing U.S.-born Blacks (e.g., youth crime) on female-headed households, absentee fathers, and nonmarital births, and that he suggests that the two-parent nuclear family is the ideal. Yet other contemporary scholars laud his work for showing that Black families are highly diverse and are resilient against a historical backdrop of deeply entrenched and systemic racism (e.g., Semmes, 2001).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Three decades after Frazier published his trailblazing work, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (1965) described Black families as “disorganized” and caught up in a “tangle of pathology.” Moynihan, too, referenced historical factors shaping experiences of Black families. For instance, he noted that the circumstances of slavery prevented Blacks from maintaining the cultural customs of their societies of origin. Slave owners often regarded them as little better than livestock and as inherently promiscuous and, therefore, unworthy of marriage. After emancipation, new cultural experiences and structural factors threatened Black families. Among these were new forms of racial discrimination, changes in the economy such as the development of sharecropping in the South after the Civil War, and the migration of Black families to Northern cities early in the twentieth century (Jones, 1986).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A persistent puzzle facing researchers is the question of why Black and White family patterns have diverged even further since the 1960s, when Moynihan’s study was published and public benefits for poor families were expanded dramatically as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society program with the goal of minimizing poverty and eradicating racial injustice. We focus on contemporary factors that have contributed to the increasingly large gap in the structure of Black and White families. In 1970, 33 percent of African American families with children under age 18 were headed by single mothers; the comparable rate among White families was 9 percent. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_587" title="587"></span>By 2016, the proportion of Black families with children under 18 headed by single mothers had risen to 55 percent, while the comparable proportion for White families was 21 percent. In addition, fewer Black families are maintained by a married couple: In 2016, 34 percent of Black families included a married couple, compared to 69 percent of White families (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2017g).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One social condition that contributes to high rates of nonmarital childbearing (and, consequently, female-headed households) is what sociologist William Julius Wilson calls a shortage of “marriageable” Black men (1987), a function of Black men’s high rates of incarceration, unemployment, and underemployment. Marriage opportunities for women are constrained if there are not enough men employed in the formal labor market. A woman is less inclined to marry a man who is not earning a living wage and may instead opt to have and raise a child on her own, rather than enter a marital union marked by financial instability. Wilson’s argument rests on the assumption that Black heterosexual women exclusively marry Black heterosexual men, an assumption that has become less defensible over time. In 1980, just five percent of Black newlyweds were married to a person of a different race; by 2015, this proportion jumped to 18 percent (Livingston and Brown, 2017). However, there is a vast gender disparity such that Black men are more than twice as likely as Black women to out-marry; in 2015, just 12 percent of Black women but fully 24 percent of Black men who were newlyweds married a partner of a different racial background. Taken together, these trends have been cited for Black women’s low rates of marriage relative to their White peers; one analysis found that just 7 percent of White but 34 percent of Black women had yet to be married by age 40 (Raley, Sweeney and Wondra, 2015).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Contemporary research provides some support for Wilson’s “marriageable male” hypothesis. Recent research confirms that one of the best predictors of whether parents marry after a nonmarital birth is the availability of eligible partners in a geographic area (Harknett and McLanahan, 2004), demonstrating the continued importance of marriage markets even after the birth of a child. However, as we shall see in the section that follows, the patterns that Wilson documented are largely limited to lower-income African Americans; middle-class Blacks reveal family patterns that are very similar to Whites.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">African Americans are often embedded in larger and more complex family networks than Whites, but these ties are a source of both support and strain. Anthropologist Carol Stack (1997) lived in a low-income Black community in Illinois to study the support systems that poor Black families formed. Getting to know the kinship system from the inside, she demonstrated that families adapted to poverty by forming large, complex support networks. Thus, a mother heading a one-parent family is likely to have a close and supportive network of relatives to depend on. Yet, these family ties often come with demands—especially on older African American women, who are more likely than any other group to live with and raise their grandchildren. They step into this role when their own children can no longer adequately fulfill their parenting role (Hughes et al., 2007).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most research on Black families to date focuses on U.S.-born African Americans. However, emerging research shows vast differences in the experiences of U.S.-born versus immigrant Blacks in the United States. For instance, among Black adults ages 18 and older in 2013, just 28 percent of U.S.-born but 48 percent of foreign-born Blacks <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_588" title="588"></span>were currently married (Anderson, 2015). The latter is nearly identical to the overall U.S. average of 50 percent. More fine-grained analyses show only slight differences in rates of marriage among immigrant Blacks from different parts of the world: 52 percent of African immigrants, 45 percent of Caribbean immigrants, and 48 percent of Black immigrants from Latin America were married. These patterns are largely due to the higher levels of education and earnings of immigrant Blacks relative to their U.S.-born counterparts; 26 percent of immigrant Blacks (vs. 19 percent of U.S.-born Blacks) have a college degree, and immigrant Blacks reported a median household income of $43,800 in 2013 (vs. just $33,500 among U.S.-born Blacks). Thus, any discussion of Black-White differences in family structure needs to consider the distinctive background and socioeconomic resources among the large and heterogeneous population of Blacks in the United States.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Asian American Families</b> Asian American families historically have been characterized by interdependence among members of the extended family. In many Asian cultures, family concerns take priority over individual concerns. Family interdependence also helps Asian Americans prosper financially. In fact, family and friend networks often pool money to help their members start a business or buy a house; this help is reciprocated through contributions to the others. The result is a median family income for Asian Americans that is higher than that for non-Hispanic Whites. As each generation of Asian Americans grows increasingly acculturated to life in the United States, however, scholars predict that they will come to resemble White families more and more (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 2012). This process may be further hastened by outmarriage. In 2015, 17 percent of all newlywed couples were interracial; however, 29 percent of Asians married that year wed a person from a different race (Livingston and Brown, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although there is less research on the differences among various Asian American subgroups than among Hispanic-origin subgroups, some fertility differences have been established. Chinese American and Japanese American women have much lower fertility rates than any other racial or ethnic group, due partly to their high levels of educational attainment. These differences in educational attainment reflect a range of economic factors, including the type of jobs their parents held, the conditions under which their families emigrated to the United States, and their language skills. As women remain in school and delay marriage and childbearing, they typically go on to have fewer children. Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino families have lower levels of nonmarital fertility than all other racial or ethnic groups, including non-Hispanic Whites. Low levels of nonmarital fertility combined with low levels of divorce for most Asian American groups demonstrate the emphasis on marriage as the appropriate forum for family formation and maintenance (Pew Research Center, 2013c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Multiracial Families</b> Young adults today are more likely than ever to date, cohabit with, and ultimately marry a partner from a different ethnic or racial background. College students may find this increase in intermarriage and interracial dating unsurprising; many of their political leaders and cultural icons like President Barack Obama, American-born British royal Meghan Markle, rapper Drake, and singer Halsey are proudly bi- or multiracial. Yet this change has been dramatic over the past six decades. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_589" title="589"></span>In 2015, 17% of all U.S. newlyweds had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity, a dramatic jump since 1967, when just 3% of newlyweds were intermarried. In that pivotal year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <i class="italic">Loving v. Virginia</i> that marriage across racial lines was legal throughout the country. Until this ruling, interracial marriage was illegal in many states (Livingston and Brown, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Given how recent these changes have been, the sociological study of multiracial families is still in its nascent forms. Some studies find no differences in the stability of same-race versus interracial marriages, whereas others find that intermarriages are more likely to end in divorce (Guzzo and Hayford, 2011; Zhang and Van Hook, 2009). More fine-grained explorations suggest that interracial marriages vary based on the race and gender of each partner. For instance, recent evidence suggests that marriage between a Black husband and White wife, and White husband and Latinx wife are slightly more likely than White-White marriages to divorce (Bratter and King 2009; Fu and Wolfinger, 2011). Studies also yield inconsistent findings regarding childbearing, with some studies showing that intermarried couples have fewer children than same-race White or Black couples (Qian and Lichter, 2017) and others showing no difference (Choi and Goldberg, 2018). Intermarried couples also are similar to same-race couples with respect to unintended pregnancy, with interracial couples mirroring that of same‐race couples from the husband’s racial or ethnic group.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Cultural values are slow to change, and as a result, some studies suggest that spouses in intermarriages (especially women) may be vulnerable to discrimination and microaggressions that undermine their well-being and the well-being of their children. For instance, White–Black couples report negative reactions from strangers as well as less support from family and friends (Childs, <span>2005</span>). Some White mothers face discrimination if they marry persons of a different ethnicity or race, as they may experience the stigma of being perceived as unqualified to raise and nurture children who are not White (Twine, <span>1999</span>). Consistent with this finding, Bratter and Eschbach (2006) found White women in intermarriages reported higher rates of distress, relative to their Black female and White male counterparts in intermarriages. However, as multiracial families become more common with each subsequent generation, discriminatory treatment and its consequences may diminish. In 1990, an astonishing 63 percent of White U.S. adults in the General Social Survey said they were “very” or “somewhat” opposed to a close relative marrying a Black person. By 2016, this share plummeted to just 14 percent (Livingston and Brown, 2017). More accepting attitudes may create a more supportive climate for parents and children alike in multiracial families.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Social Class and American Families</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists studying racial and ethnic differences in American families are always keenly aware of the role that social class plays. As we learned in <a href="part0071_split_000.html#23MNU0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 11</a>, Whites, Blacks, Native Americans, Latinos, and Asians differ starkly with respect to their levels of education, the kinds of jobs they hold, their income, their savings, and whether they own homes. Economic and occupational stability is a powerful influence on families, where those with richer resources are more likely to marry and to have children within (rather than outside of) marriage. Even studies that focus primarily on race are essentially studies of social class, because race, ethnicity, immigration status, and class have historically been so closely intertwined. Contemporary researchers now largely <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_590" title="590"></span>agree that “the differences between [U.S.-born] Black and White extended family relationships are mainly due to contemporary differences in social and economic class positions of group members. Cultural differences are less significant” (Sarkisian and Gerstel, 2004).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This finding leads us to a thought-provoking and policy-relevant question: Are racial differences in family formation due primarily to economic or to cultural factors? Consider an example of four individuals, all women, who are the heads of their households: (1) a Black doctor, (2) a White doctor, (3) a Black nurse’s aide, and (4) a White nurse’s aide. The cultural argument suggests that Blacks and Whites are different, which means that the Black doctor and Black nurse’s aide should have family lives that are more similar to each other than they are to the family lives of the White doctor or White nurse’s aide. The class argument argues the opposite: that the two nurse’s aides and the two doctors will be more similar to each other than they will be to people of the same race but from a different class position.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Recent studies show that race and class each have distinctive and often complicated influences on family behavior. For instance, while Whites from working-class and poor, often rural, backgrounds—often residing in the southern United States—report very strong ideological support for marriage and bearing children within marriage, their behaviors often depart from these conservative ideals. White young adults of lower- and working-class backgrounds are much more likely than their wealthier peers to get pregnant prior to marriage, marry young, and subsequently divorce (Cahn and Carbone, 2010). Because they often do not attend college, they marry young and bear children young—often before they are financially or emotionally prepared. As a result, they often struggle unsuccessfully with the challenges of marriage and babies, and ultimately divorce. In the past decade, White working-class families have been particularly vulnerable to the opioid crisis, where a young adult’s addiction can derail their life chances and destabilize family well-being. For young adult addicts with small children, addiction and death by overdose often means that older adults become custodial grandparents to their orphaned grandchildren (Whalen, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Middle-class young adults, by contrast, show much more stable family formation patterns. Many cohabit while in school or working in their first jobs, so they marry later and bear children later. Delaying marriage until they are emotionally and financially ready is one of the key reasons college-educated young Whites have lower rates of divorce than their more economically disadvantaged counterparts (Cahn and Carbone, 2010).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Research comparing middle-class Blacks with their less-advantaged counterparts was scarce until the past decade or two, when scholars began to explore middle-class Black families in depth (Lacy, 2007; Landry and Marsh, 2011; Pattillo, 2013). Although middle-class Black families are much more likely than their less economically advantaged peers to live in married-couple households, recent studies detect a new form of middle-class Black family, especially among young adults—the single-person household. Due in part to the shortage of marriageable men and Black men’s fairly high rate of intermarrying described earlier, college-educated Black women often live on their own without a romantic partner (Marsh et al., 2007). Studies of intersectionality, or the complex interplay between race and class, provide important insights into the ways both culture and structure shape family lives.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_591" title="591"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Nonmarital Childbearing</b> Nonmarital childbearing continues to be one of the most hotly debated and well-researched areas of family sociology. This intense interest is driven, in part, by the fact that the number of children born outside of a marital union today is more than six times higher than it was in the 1950s (see Figure 15.4). Nonmarital childbearing rates peaked in 2008 and have since declined, but they remain high—especially for ethnic minorities. In 2015, 71 percent of all births to Black women, 66 percent of births to American Indian or Alaska Native women, and 53 percent of births to Hispanic women occurred outside marriage, compared with 29 percent for non-Hispanic White women and 16 percent for Asian or Pacific Islander women (Martin et al., 2017). Yet these numbers can be misleading because they suggest that babies are being born to women without male partners, thus denying the children a “father figure.” Recent studies show that the majority (63 percent) of all nonmarital births take place in cohabiting unions (Wildsmith, Manlove, and Cook, 2018), meaning that many of these children are raised by two parents who just happen not to be legally married to each other.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A key question sociologists address is, why do women have children out of wedlock? This is an important concern to policy makers because children born to unmarried mothers are more likely to grow up in a single-parent household, experience instability in living arrangements, and live in poverty. As these children reach adolescence, they are more likely to have low educational attainment, engage in sex at younger ages, and have a premarital birth. As young adults, children born outside marriage are more <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_592" title="592"></span>likely to be idle (neither in school nor employed), have lower occupational status and income, and have more troubled marriages and more divorces than those born to married parents. Studies of children born into unmarried cohabiting unions generally show that they fare better on average than those children born to mothers without a coresidential partner, yet they still fare worse on average than those born into marital unions (Manning, 2015).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Of course, most studies conclude that it is not single or cohabiting mothers who are the problem, but rather, the economically disadvantaged conditions that both give rise to and follow from nonmarital childbearing (Child Trends, 2012). For children of cohabiting parents, instability in the parents’ relationship statuses—such as break-ups and new partnerships—also is a source of children’s disadvantage regarding school outcomes and health (Fomby and Cherlin, 2007; Manning, 2015). We revisit this topic in our consideration of family structure and child well-being.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas (2005) ask why low-income women continue to have children out of wedlock when they can hardly afford to do so. Following in the tradition of scholars such as Carol Stack and Elijah Anderson, Edin and Kefalas lived with their subjects—among poor Blacks, Whites, and Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia and in Camden, New Jersey. Their interviews with 165 low-income single mothers in Black and White neighborhoods led them to argue that single mothers were not eschewing marriage. To the contrary, women of all ethnicities whom they interviewed highly valued marriage but believed that getting married at that time would make things worse, either committing them to terrible relationships or leading to divorce. As one woman told Edin and Kefalas, “I’d rather say I had a child out of wedlock than that I married this idiot.” Or, as others said, a failed marriage would be worse than having children on their own. In an environment in which more men than ever were going to prison or were unemployed, these women needed to be able to fend for themselves.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Two-thirds of the pregnancies in the study were neither planned nor actively avoided. This figure is much higher than the national average, where one-third of all nonmarital pregnancies are considered “unintended” (Curtin, Ventura, and Martinez, 2014). In the poor communities that Edin and Kefalas (2005) studied, women stopped using contraception when the relationship became serious, even if the woman and man had not planned to have children together.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">But why do women have children out of wedlock in the first place? For one thing, the researchers find that young people in poor communities feel very confident about their ability to raise children, more so than most middle-class people do. This is because most of the pregnant mothers came from social environments in which young people helped raise the other children in a family or in a building.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Second, people living in poverty place a high value on children, perhaps an even higher value than do middle-class families. Part of the reason for this is that they have fewer things to make their lives meaningful; going to college and finding a professional job are rarely options for low-income, inner-city young women. For them, having children brings meaning and order to a life that may be marked by disappointment or chaos (Edin and Kefalas, 2005).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A third reason to “retreat from marriage” has to do with the changing meaning of marriage in low-income communities. Although low-income women do value marriage, what qualifies a man as a potential marital partner has changed over the last 50 years. Edin and Kefalas comment that “in the 1950s all but the most marginally <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_593" title="593"></span>employed men found women who were willing to marry them. Now, however, even men who are stably employed at relatively good jobs at the time of the child’s birth . . . aren’t automatically deemed marriageable.” This view is consistent with the work of sociologist William Julius Wilson (1987), who theorized that a lack of “marriageable” men contributed to low rates of marriage among poor African Americans.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Taken together, this research suggests that women have become more selective. When women who value motherhood highly also set the bar higher for marriage, higher rates of nonmarital fertility follow. Through Edin and Kefalas’s (2005) work, we can understand the worldviews of Black, White, and Puerto Rican young people who are having children out of wedlock.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Class-Based Cultural Practices</b> Social class shapes more than just whether one marries or cohabits, and whether or when one has children. Many sociological studies have found that child-rearing practices also are powerfully shaped by social class (Sherman and Harris, 2012). In her classic book <i class="italic">Worlds of Pain,</i> sociologist Lillian Rubin (1977) proposed that children raised in low-income or working-class families were socialized to feel powerless, which would render them vulnerable to anger, and a limited capacity to plan for the future in adulthood. Rubin’s work set the stage for contemporary scholars like Annette Lareau, whose work reveals how cultural differences in values and beliefs can result in divergent child-rearing, parenting, and disciplinary practices.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Annette Lareau (2011) concluded that middle-class parents engage in “concerted cultivation,” working hard to cultivate their children’s talents through many nonschool-based activities, as well as continuous linguistic interaction. Working-class and low-income parents, by contrast, focus their childrearing on the “accomplishment of natural growth”: Talk is brief and instrumental, children learn to be more compliant with adult directives, and they participate in few organized activities outside school. They learn to occupy themselves, often playing with neighborhood friends. Lareau drew these conclusions by closely observing 12 families—6 White, 5 Black, and 1 interracial.</p>
<figure class="figure--fullwidth" data-figure-id="ch15ph08"><a data-href="../images/Ch15ph08.jpg" tabindex="0" data-size="2518x1651"><img class="figure__image" alt="" src="../images/00227.jpeg" data-image-id="ch15ph08"/></a>
<figcaption class="figure__caption">According to Annette Lareau, middle-class parents and working-class parents adopt different child-rearing strategies: Middle-class parents engage in “concerted cultivation,” keeping their children busy with nonschool-based activities such as organized sports. Working-class parents undertake the “accomplishment of natural growth.”</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As a result of these child-rearing strategies, Lareau claims, middle-class children develop a sense of entitlement and value an individualized sense of self. They become comfortable questioning authority and making demands on adults and institutions. In contrast, the working-class child-rearing strategy promotes a sense of constraint in children, who become more cautious in dealing with adults, bureaucratic institutions, and authority. Like anthropologist Carol Stack, Lareau also finds that working-class and low-income parents place great importance on close kin ties; thus, these children develop closer <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_594" title="594"></span>relationships with their siblings, cousins, and other relatives. Recognizing the possible dangers of attributing differences to “culture,” Lareau carefully points out that the differences between working-class and middle-class child-rearing practices do not reflect radically different values and priorities but, instead, vastly different levels of income and wealth. Her evidence suggests that if economically disadvantaged parents had more money, their child-rearing strategies would change.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Divorce and Separation</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Divorce rates increased steadily through the latter half of the twentieth century, yet they have leveled off in recent years. Attitudes have changed in tandem, with a stark decline in the proportion of Americans who disapprove of divorce. Whereas for centuries in the West, marriage was regarded as indissoluble, today, most countries are making divorce more easily available. Divorce rates (based on the number of divorces per 1,000 married men or women per year) have fluctuated in the United States in different periods (Figure 15.5). They rose, for example, after World War II, then dropped off to very low levels in the 1950s before increasing steeply from the 1960s to 1980 (thereafter tapering off and declining somewhat). It used to be common for divorced women to move back to their parents’ homes; today, most set up their own households.</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/></div>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Divorce has a substantial impact on children. Since 1970, more than 1 million American children per year have been affected by divorce. In one calculation, about half of children born in 1980 became members of a one-parent family. Since two-thirds of women and three-fourths of men who are divorced eventually remarry, most of these children nonetheless grew up in a family environment, often acquiring new stepsiblings in the process. In 2016, less than 4 percent of children under 18 in the United States were not living with either parent. Remarriage rates are substantially lower for African Americans. Only 32 percent of Black women and 55 percent of Black <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_595" title="595"></span>men who divorce remarry within 10 years. White children are more than twice as likely as Black children (71 percent versus 34 percent) to reside in a home with two married parents (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2017d).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Divorce also takes a significant toll on the spouses, although the financial toll is much more severe for women than men. According to one study, the living standards of divorced women and their children fell by 27 percent in the first year following the divorce settlement. The average standard of living of divorced men, by contrast, rose by 10 percent. However, more in-depth investigations find that the economic toll on men varies widely based on the spouses’ financial arrangements prior to divorce and custody arrangements following divorce. For instance, one study found that men who were contributing more than 80 percent to family income prior to divorce improved their living standards after divorce by approximately 10 percent at the median, but that for men who contributed a smaller share to family income, divorce resulted in a reduction in living standards (McManus and DiPrete, 2001).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The psychological consequences of divorce, by contrast, are less profound than previously thought. Although divorced women may report heightened symptoms of depression and divorced men may experience increases in depressive symptoms and drinking behavior in the first year or two after divorce, most fare well in the longer term. Remarriage provides significant psychological benefits to men and both psychological and economic benefits to women. However, divorces marked by high levels of acrimony and conflicts regarding child support and child-rearing, for example, often bring psychological strain and distress to the ex-spouses even several years after their marriages have ended (Carr and Springer, 2010; Carr, Springer, and Williams, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Reasons for Divorce</b> Divorce rates are not a direct indicator of marital unhappiness. For example, they do not include separated people who are not legally divorced. Moreover, unhappily married people may stay together because they believe in the sanctity of marriage, worry about the consequences of breaking up, decide to remain together for the sake of the children, or can’t afford the costs of divorce proceedings and maintaining two separate residences.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Why did divorce become increasingly common throughout the latter half of the twentieth century? There are several reasons, which involve the wider changes in modern societies and social institutions. First, changes in the law have made divorce easier. Today, individuals may file for a “no-fault” divorce, where one or both parties want the marriage to end and there is no need to present evidence that one spouse is at “fault.” Through the first six decades of the twentieth century, by contrast, one party had to prove that the other was at “fault,” necessitating compelling evidence of abuse, neglect, infidelity, or other forms of mistreatment that could be difficult to prove from a legal standpoint (Marvell, 1989).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Second, except for a few wealthy people, marriage no longer reflects the desire to perpetuate property and status across generations. As women become more economically independent, it is easier for them to establish a separate household (Lee, 1982). The fact that little stigma is now attached to divorce is partly the result of these developments but also adds momentum to them. Third, there is a growing tendency to evaluate marriage in terms of personal satisfaction. Rising divorce rates do not indicate dissatisfaction with marriage as such, but an increased determination to make it a <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_596" title="596"></span>rewarding and satisfying relationship for the individual spouses, with a reduced desire to stay (unhappily) married “for the sake of the children” (Cherlin, 2009).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Divorce and Children</b> The effects of divorce on children are difficult to gauge, and both public sentiment and scholarly research have evolved dramatically over the past four decades. Scholarly interest has shifted as well, with researchers moving away from the very specific question of how divorce affects children, and instead exploring how family instability—including parental divorces and cohabitation break-ups, repartnering, and other changes in the household—affect children’s emotional, physical, and cognitive development. As we shall see in the sections below, social selection—or the factors that give rise to parental relationship instability—also may take a toll on child well-being.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Researchers also recognize that not all relationship dissolutions are the same. The conditions under which a parent dissolved their union also bear on child outcomes. For instance, how contentious the relationship is between the parents before separation; the ages of the children; whether there are siblings, grandparents, and other relatives; the children’s relationship with their individual parents; and how frequently the children continue to see both parents—all affect the adjustment process.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Early studies of divorce found that children may suffer emotional anxiety right after their parents’ separation, yet these effects are relatively short-lived. In a classic study, Judith Wallerstein and Joan Kelly (1980) tracked 131 children of 60 families in Marin County, California, after the separation of their parents. They contacted the children at the time of the divorce, a year and a half after, and five years after. Almost all the children experienced intense emotional disturbance at the time of the divorce. Preschool-age children were confused and frightened, blaming themselves for the separation. Older children better understood their parents’ motives for the split but worried about its effects on their future and expressed anger over it. At the end of the five-year period, however, two-thirds were coping reasonably well with their home lives and their outside commitments. One-third remained dissatisfied, and expressed feelings of sadness and loneliness, even when the parent they were living with had remarried.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Wallerstein continued studying 116 of the original 131 subjects at the end of 10-year and 15-year periods (1980, 1989, 2000). She found that these children brought memories and feelings of their parents’ divorce into their own romantic relationships. Almost all felt they had suffered from their parents’ mistakes. Most of them shared a hope for something their parents had failed to achieve—a good, committed marriage based on love and faithfulness. Although many of them got married, the legacy of their parents’ divorce lived with them. Those who appeared to manage the best had supportive relationships with one or both parents.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Can we reasonably conclude, then, that divorce is bad for children? Despite the many strengths of the Wallerstein study, including an unusually long follow-up period, it also had many limitations that undermine its generalizability. The parents and children studied all came from an affluent White area and might or might not have been representative of the wider population. Moreover, the families were self-selected: They had approached counselors. Those who actively seek counseling might be less (or more) able to cope with separation than those who do not. In general, studies based on “clinical” or help-seeking samples tend to overstate problems; by definition, the study participants were troubled enough that they had sought professional help.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_597" title="597"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">More recent studies based on population samples found that people with divorced parents had slightly worse mental health, on average, than those whose parents stayed together but much of the difference had been identified in the children at age seven, before the families experienced divorce (Cherlin, Chase-Lansdale, and McRae, 1998). Recent syntheses of decades of research have identified several common consequences of divorce for children (Amato and Keith, 1991; Amato, 2001):</p>
<ul class="contents">
<li class="bcpt"><span>Almost all children experience an initial period of intense emotional upset after their parents separate.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>Most resume normal development without serious problems within two years of the separation.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>A minority of children experience some long-term problems as a result of the breakup that may persist into adulthood.</span></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="repartnering-and-stepparenting">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_4">Repartnering and Stepparenting</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Before 1900, almost all marriages in the United States were first marriages. Most remarriages involved at least one widowed person. With the progressive rise in the divorce rate, the level of remarriage also began to climb, and in an increasing proportion of remarriages at least one person was divorced. Today, fully 40 percent of marriages involve at least one previously married person and 20 percent involve two previously married persons (Livingston, 2014b). Up to age 35, the majority of remarriages are between divorced people. After that age, the proportion of remarriages with widows or widowers rises (Sweeney, 2010). Over the past two decades, however, some divorced and widowed persons are turning their back on marriage, instead preferring to cohabit or to date steadily without living together, a relationship referred to as living apart together (LAT) (Brown and Wright, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While repartnering—whether through marriage or cohabitation—has become the norm for formerly married people, men are more likely than women to repartner, and more highly educated, financially secure people are more likely than their less advantaged peers to form new unions (Livingston, 2014). While remarriages provide many of the same benefits as first marriages, including love, companionship, and the economies of scale that come from sharing a household, they also are more likely to result in divorce (Cherlin, 2009). This statistic does not mean that second marriages are doomed to fail. Divorced people may have higher expectations of marriage than those who remain with their first spouses; hence, they may be more ready to dissolve new marriages. The second marriages that endure are usually more satisfying than the first.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The rise in rates of remarriage and cohabitations after one’s first union dissolved has been accompanied by a rising number of stepfamilies. A <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-stepfamily" href="part0099_split_005.html#stepfamily">stepfamily</a> refers to a family in which at least one of the adults is a stepparent. Many who repartner become stepparents of children who regularly visit rather than live in the same household. By this definition, the number of stepfamilies is much greater than official statistics indicate because the statistics usually refer only to families with whom stepchildren live. Stepfamilies give rise to kin ties resembling those of some traditional societies in non-Western countries. Children may now have <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_598" title="598"></span>four parents involved in their lives: their natural parents and their stepparents. Some stepfamilies regard all the children and close relatives (including grandparents) from previous marriages as part of the family.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Certain difficulties arise in stepfamilies. First, there is usually a biological parent living elsewhere whose influence over the child or children remains powerful. Cooperative relations between ex-partners often become strained when one or both remarry or enter a new cohabiting union. Consider a woman with two children who marries a man with two children, all six living together. If the “outside” parents demand the same times of visitation as previously, the pressures on the newly established family will likely be intense. It may prove impossible to have the new family all together on weekends.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Second, since most stepchildren belong to two households, the possibilities of clashes of habits and outlooks are considerable (Fine, Coleman, and Ganong, 1998). There are few established norms defining the relationship between stepparent and stepchild. Should a child call a new stepparent by name, or is “Dad” or “Mom” more appropriate? Should the stepparent play the same part in disciplining the children as the natural parent? How should a stepparent treat the new spouse of his or her previous partner when picking up the children? The difficulties in negotiating these decisions often intensify in later life as aging parents need to turn to their children for caregiving, and stepchildren may not willingly oblige (Sherman, Webster, and Antonucci, 2013).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_5">Single-Parent Households</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As a result of increasing divorce rates and births outside of marriage, more than half of all children will spend at least some time in a single-parent family. In 2016, 20.2 million children under the age of 18, representing about a quarter of all children, lived with one parent: 17.2 million with their mother and 3 million with their father. More than 80 percent of such families are headed by women because the mother usually obtains custody of the children after a divorce (in a few single-parent households, the individual, again almost always a woman, has never been married). There were 11 million single-parent households with children under age 18 in the United States in 2018, 8.8 million single-mother and 2.1 million single-father families (Figure 15.6), constituting about 30 percent of all families with children under 18 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2019a). They are among the poorest groups in contemporary society.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The category of single-parent households is internally diverse. For instance, more than half of widowed mothers are homeowners, but the majority of never-married single mothers live in rented accommodations. Single parenthood tends to be a changing state. For a person who is widowed, the break is clear-cut—although they have been living alone for some while if the partner was hospitalized before death. About 60 percent of single-parent households today, however, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_599" title="599"></span>are the result of separation or divorce. In such cases, individuals may live together sporadically over a lengthy period.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most people do not wish to be single parents, but a growing minority choose to have a child or children without the support of a spouse or partner. “Single mothers by choice” aptly describes some parents who possess sufficient resources to manage as a single-parent household. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the most rapidly increasing rates of nonmarital births between the years 2007 and 2012 were to unmarried women ages 35 and older. During the same period, rates of nonmarital births among younger women either declined or stayed stable. Women in their late thirties and forties today recognize that they can have a child on their own without facing the stigma that plagued single mothers in earlier generations. Many also have the financial means to support a child on their own (Curtin, Ventura, and Martinez, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For the majority of unmarried or never-married mothers, however, the reality is different: There is a high correlation between the rate of births outside marriage and indicators of poverty and social deprivation. These are key influences underlying the high proportion of single-parent households among families of African American background in the United States.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists debate the effect on children of growing up with a single parent. A highly influential study by Sara McLanahan and Gary Sandefur (1994) rejects the claim that children raised by only one parent do just as well as children raised by both parents. A large part of the reason is economic: the sudden drop in income associated with divorce. Other reasons include inadequate parental attention and lack of social ties. Separation or divorce weakens the connection between child and father, and the link between the child and the father’s network of friends and acquaintances. The authors conclude it is a myth that strong support networks or extended family ties are usually available to single mothers. Others have also pointed out that although <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_600" title="600"></span>most children growing up in single-parent homes are disadvantaged, it is better for children’s mental health if parents in extremely high-conflict marriages divorce rather than stay together (Amato, Loomis, and Booth, 1995). Divorce may benefit children growing up in high-conflict households while harming children whose parents have relatively low levels of marital conflict before divorcing.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_6">Being Child-Free</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The number of Americans who do not have children increased steadily throughout the 1980s and 1990s, yet has recently dipped (Livingston, 2015). Calculating precisely who is child-free is difficult; researchers historically have classified a woman as having no children if she has had zero children by age 44. Using this metric, proportion of women ages forty to forty-four with no children—regardless of marital status—climbed from 10 percent in 1986 to 15 percent in 1986 to 20 percent in 2006; the share had dropped to 14 percent by 2016.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">White women between the ages of 15 and 50, both married and unmarried, are considerably more likely than Black or Hispanic women to be child-free (44.4 percent vs. 40.8 percent, and 44.2 percent respectively), although Asian women are more likely than any other race to be childless at 45.5 percent (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018a). Women with a college degree or higher are more likely than high school graduates or dropouts to have no children. Most studies find that a relatively small fraction of these women are involuntarily childless; with advances in health and technology, the proportion who cannot physically bear children is modest. Rather, the reasons are often social and psychological, including not having a partner with whom one would want to have a child, a preference for a child-free lifestyle, concerns about the environment and bringing a child into an unsafe world, and concerns about whether one has the financial and emotional wherewithal to have a child (Connidis and McMullin, 1996; Jacobson and Heaton, 1991).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Childlessness was historically viewed as a stigmatized identity, a mark of a “barren” woman or a woman who was “selfish” and prioritized her own career pursuits over motherhood (May, 1997). However, in recent decades, being child-free has been increasingly recognized as a status that is desirable and even preferable for many women and men. Those who do not have children have myriad opportunities to “give back” to the next generation by volunteering or caring for nieces or nephews, should they choose to do so (Sandler, 2013).</p>

<section id="same-sex-couples">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_7">Same-Sex Couples</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ)-identified persons live in stable relationships as couples today. According to estimates from the 2010 Census, there are 131,729 same-sex married-couple households and 514,735 same-sex unmarried-partner households in the United States (U.S. Bureau of the Census Bureau, 2011p). Same-sex couples account for roughly 1 percent of households in the United States today (Lofquist, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The number of same-sex partners who are legally married is expected to skyrocket in the next decade. One of the most profound and rapid social changes of the twenty-first century has been the legalization of gay marriage. One important turning point occurred in June 2013, when the U.S. Supreme Court declared the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) to be unconstitutional in the landmark <i class="italic">Windsor v. United States of America</i>. DOMA, passed by Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_601" title="601"></span>had defined marriage as “a legal union between one man and one woman.” Yet an even more important and path-breaking Supreme Court decision was handed down on June 26, 2015, when the Court ruled by a 5 to 4 vote that the U.S. Constitution guarantees individuals the right to same-sex marriage. Technically, the ruling says that states cannot prohibit the issuing of marriage licenses to same-sex couples or deny recognition of lawfully performed out-of-state marriage licenses to same-sex couples. This ruling invalidated same-sex marriage bans and effectively made same-sex marriage legal in every state in the nation (Liptak, 2015).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The United States is not alone in its rapidly growing acceptance of same-sex unions. A growing number of countries have legalized same-sex marriage, including Argentina, Canada, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Denmark, Uruguay, New Zealand, South Africa, Germany, and France, and, most recently, Northern Ireland, Ecuador, and Austria. Other parts of the world are slower to adapt; South Africa is the only nation in Africa where same-sex marriage is legally recognized (Human Rights Campaign, 2017). Similarly, Taiwan became the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide in May 2019 and in 2020 Costa Rica became the first nation in Central America to legalize gay marriage.</p>
