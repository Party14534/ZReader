<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Is Democracy in Trouble?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Democracy almost everywhere is in some peril. This is not only because it is hard to set up a stable democratic order in places such as Russia and other formerly Communist societies. Democracy is in trouble even in its countries of origin—such as the United States. For example, as just noted, voter turnout in presidential and other elections has generally declined. In surveys, many people say they don’t trust politicians.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 1964, confidence in government was fairly high: Nearly four out of five people answered “most of the time” or “just about always” when asked, “How much of the time do you trust the government in Washington to do the right thing?” This level of confidence dropped steadily for the following 20 years, rose somewhat in the 1980s, then dropped to a low of one in five in 1994. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, a solid majority (55 percent) of Americans reported that they trusted the government “most of the time” or “just about always.” Recently, however, trust in the government has declined as a result of disillusionment over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the economic collapse of 2008, the tepid recovery that followed, and government paralysis in Washington. By 2019, just 17 percent of Americans said they could trust the government in Washington almost always or most of the time (Pew Research Center, 2019f).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Roughly half of all Americans believe that government is too large, a perception that in part reflects this low level of trust (Pew Research Center, 2019d). Yet among the 27 industrial democracies in the OECD, the United States ranks 24th in terms of total federal, state, and local government spending as a proportion of its total economy. Nine OECD countries spend more than half of their GDP on government at all levels, with France and Finland topping the list at 57 percent of GDP. The United States, by way of comparison, spends only 37 percent (OECD, 2015). There are, however, significant differences among those who believe that government is too big. One obvious difference is partisanship: While roughly three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents prefer a smaller government providing fewer services, two-thirds of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents prefer a large government that provides more services. There are significant differences by age as well: While 50 percent of younger Americans (30 and under) favor larger government, only 43 percent of those over 65 share this opinion (Pew Research Center, 2019d).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Americans may have lower taxes than other industrial democracies, but they also receive lower levels of support for health care, housing, education, unemployment, and social services in general. This may be another reason for low levels of confidence in government and poor voter turnout: Americans expect less, and get less, from their government.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Finally, for the past quarter century, there has been a steady stream of well-financed criticism from conservative think tanks, news media, and politicians who share the belief that government is part of the problem, rather than part of the solution. This has been highly effective in changing the national discourse on the role of government (Gonzales and Delgado, 2006).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Why are so many people dissatisfied with democracy, a political system that not long ago seemed to be sweeping across the world? The answers may be bound up with the very factors that help spread democracy—the effect of capitalism and the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_500" title="500"></span>globalizing of social life. For instance, while capitalist economies generate more wealth than any other type of economic system, the wealth is unequally distributed (see <a href="part0053_split_000.html#1IHDQ0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 8</a>). And economic inequalities influence who votes, joins parties, and gets elected. Wealthy individuals and corporations back interest groups that lobby elected officials to support their aims when deciding on legislation. Not being subject to election, interest groups are not accountable to the majority of the electorate (Lessig, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Economic inequalities also create an underclass of people living in poverty—about 20 percent of the population of liberal democracies. Most Western liberal democracies establish policies to reduce poverty levels, but they vary in spending to achieve that aim. Societies that implement a complex welfare system require a higher level of taxation and a larger nonelected government bureaucracy. The question arises as to how much of an economic and political price a society is willing to pay to reduce poverty, who pays for it, and what the effect is of this cost.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the modern welfare state, government was expected to provide a wide range of services to be funded by taxes on individuals and corporations. During much of the twentieth century, when the economies of the advanced industrial nations were to a large extent based within national borders, this strategy met with some success—at least during times of economic growth, when businesses were thriving, personal incomes were rising, and government revenues were strong. Political parties tried to woo voters by promising many benefits and services; as a result, governments acquired more responsibilities than they could easily fund and manage, from establishing public ownership of industries, utilities, and transportation to creating extensive welfare programs.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A half century ago, sociologist James O’Connor’s <i class="italic">Fiscal Crisis of the State</i> (1973) predicted that a gap would occur between state expenditures and revenues. Globalization, which facilitated the easy movement of capital, has contributed to this crisis. The offshoring of manufacturing to low-wage countries contributed to the decline of manufacturing in the United States, and with it, the loss of millions of jobs that once paid middle-class wages. This both reduced personal income available for taxation and contributed to an increase in the cost of such government-funded services as unemployment compensation and welfare payments. During the twenty-first century, automation has arguably claimed as many, or many more, jobs than the offshoring of manufacturing, a trend that is likely to increase in coming years (Hicks and Devaraj, 2015). Taxes on corporations, as a portion of federal revenues, have also declined: In 1970, corporate income taxes accounted for 25 percent of federal government revenue, while in 2018, the corporate share had dropped to only 6 percent (CBPP, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The 2016 election, with its strong populist appeal, highlighted the fact that the Democratic Party in the United States has lost some of its traditional support from working-class voters, who needed the promised (but undelivered) services. The rise of alt-right politics reflects an attempt to cope with this situation by trimming back the state and encouraging private enterprise—a trend seen in Europe as well as the United States.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Jürgen Habermas (1975) argued that this situation should be understood as a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-legitimation-crisis" href="part0087_split_004.html#legitimation-crisis">legitimation crisis</a> (Offe, 1984, 1985), since modern governments lack the legitimacy to carry out tasks they are required to undertake, such as providing highways, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_501" title="501"></span>public housing, and health care. People who feel that they pay most for these services through higher taxes—the more affluent—may believe they gain the least from them. On the one hand, governments must take more responsibility for reducing poverty and homelessness; on the other, taxpayers either resist increases in taxation or want taxes reduced. Governments cannot cope with the contradictory demands of lower taxes and more responsibilities, leading to decreased public support and general disillusionment about government’s capabilities. According to Habermas, legitimation crises could probably be overcome if the electorate were persuaded to accept high taxation in return for a wide range of government services.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As sociologist Daniel Bell (1976) observed a half century ago, national government is too small to address the big questions, such as the influence of global economic competition or the destruction of the world’s environment, but it has become too big to address the small questions, such as issues affecting cities or regions. Governments have little power, for instance, over giant business corporations, the main actors within the global economy. A U.S. corporation may shut down its production plants in America and set up a new factory in Mexico in order to lower costs and compete with other corporations. The result is that thousands of American workers lose their jobs and expect the government to do something, but national governments cannot control processes bound up with the world economy. All a government can do is soften the blow—for example, by providing unemployment benefits or job retraining.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">At the same time that governments have shrunk in relation to global issues, they have become more remote from the lives of most citizens. Many Americans resent that “power brokers” in Washington—party officials, interest groups, lobbyists, and bureaucratic officials—make decisions affecting their lives. They also believe that government is unable to address important local issues, such as crime and homelessness. Thus, Americans’ faith in government has dropped substantially, which affects Americans’ willingness to participate in the political process.</p>
