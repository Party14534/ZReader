<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is impossible to understand ethnic and racial divisions today without considering the effect of Western colonialism on the rest of the world (Global Map 11.1); global migratory movements resulting from colonialism helped create ethnic divisions by placing peoples in close proximity.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">From the fifteenth century onward, Europeans ventured into seas previously uncharted and unexplored by them, pursuing exploration and trade but also conquering native peoples and settling in new areas. Europeans also occasioned a large-scale movement of people from Africa to the Americas via the slave trade. The following extraordinary shifts in population have occurred in the past 350 years or so:</p>
<ol class="fmnl">
<li class="bcpt" value="1"><b class="bold1">Europe to North America.</b> Since the seventeenth century, some 45 million people have emigrated from Europe to what are now the United States and Canada. About 200 million people in North America today trace their ancestry to this migration.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_390" title="390"></span><b class="bold1">Europe to Central and South America.</b> About 20 million people, mostly from Spain, Portugal, and Italy, have migrated to Central and South America. Some 50 million people in these areas today are of European ancestry.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="3"><b class="bold1">Europe to Africa and Australasia.</b> Approximately 17 million people in Africa and Australasia are of European ancestry. In Africa, the majority of emigrants went to the state of South Africa, which was colonized mainly by the British and the Dutch.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="4"><b class="bold1">Africa to the Americas.</b> Starting in the sixteenth century, about 10 million Blacks were unwillingly transported to the North and South American continents. Fewer than 1 million arrived in the sixteenth century; some 1.3 million in the seventeenth century; 6 million in the eighteenth century; and 2 million in the nineteenth century.</li>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">This map shows the massive movement of peoples from Europe who colonized the Americas, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, resulting in the ethnic composition of populations there today.

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These population flows underlie the current ethnic composition of the United States, Canada, the countries of Central and South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. In all these societies, the indigenous populations were decimated by disease, war, and genocide, and subjected to European rule. They are now impoverished ethnic minorities. Because the Europeans themselves had diverse national and ethnic origins, they transplanted ethnic hierarchies and divisions to their new homelands. At the height of the colonial era, Europeans also ruled over native populations in South Asia, East Asia, the South Pacific, and the Middle East.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Throughout European expansion, ethnocentric attitudes caused many colonists to believe that, as Christians, they were on a civilizing mission to the rest of the world. Europeans of all political persuasions believed themselves superior to the peoples they colonized and conquered. The fact that many of those peoples possessed technologies, agricultural skills, and knowledge that the Europeans embraced and incorporated (for <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_391" title="391"></span>example, the civil service system in India) seemed irrelevant, because the Europeans possessed the power to institutionalize their interpretation of the relationship between themselves and the rest of the world. The early period of colonization coincided with the rise of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-scientific-racism" href="part0074_split_007.html#scientific-racism">scientific racism</a>, or the misuse of science to support racist assumptions, and ever since then, the legacy of colonization has generated ethnic divisions that have affected regional and global conflicts. In particular, racist views distinguishing the descendants of Europeans from those of Africans became central to European racist attitudes.</p>
