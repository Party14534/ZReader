<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In recent years, the daily news has all too often reported incidents involving police officers killing unarmed Black men. On the heels of these tragedies, many African American parents struggle not only to explain these events to their children but also to raise their children (especially their sons) to navigate and thrive in this increasingly uncertain world (Canedy, 2016). Many parents realize that it is not accurate to tell children that we live in a color-blind world and should instead teach the next generation to respect people from all backgrounds and walks of life.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">How did you learn about your racial or ethnic background? Did your parents ever teach you what it means to be a White, Black, Asian, or Latino American? Or whether, as a member of a particular ethnic or racial group, there are certain ways you should act? Sociologists have recently explored the process of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-race-socialization" href="part0031_split_002.html#race-socialization">race socialization</a>, which refers to the specific verbal and nonverbal messages that older generations transmit to younger generations regarding the meaning and significance of race, racial stratification, intergroup relations, and personal identity (Lesane-Brown, 2006).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The research team of sociologist Tony Brown and psychologist Chase Lesane-Brown has conducted rich and important work on race socialization, investigating the messages that parents teach, how these messages have changed over time, and the effects of this socialization on children’s lives. Their work rests on the assumption that ethnic minority parents (especially Black parents) must socialize their children to be productive members of society, just as White parents do, yet they also face an additional challenge: raising children with the skills to survive and prosper in a society that often devalues Blackness. As part of race socialization, Black parents also may prepare their children to understand their heritage, cultures, and what it means to belong to a racial group that historically has occupied a low and stigmatized status in the United States (Brown and Lesane-Brown, 2006).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Their research shows that while parents of all racial and ethnic groups discuss their heritage with their children, parents of color—especially Black parents—do so more often than White parents. For example, in one study, the researchers asked parents, “How often does someone in your family talk with your child about (his/her) ethnic/racial heritage?” (Brown et al., 2006). They found that Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, American Indian, and multiracial families were significantly more likely than White families to discuss their ethnic/racial heritage with their young children. In fact, the odds of discussing children’s ethnic/racial heritage in non-White families were 1.9 to 4.7 times the odds for White families.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What exactly do Black parents teach their children about race, race stratification, and race relations? Lesane-Brown, Brown, and colleagues (2005) developed a detailed index capturing the specific messages and lessons that parents pass down to their children, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_122" title="122"></span>noting of course that families may vary in what they say and how they say it. Among the messages encompassed in race socialization are color blindness (e.g., “race doesn’t matter”), individual pride (e.g., “I can achieve anything”), group pride (e.g., “I’m proud to be Black”), distrust of other racial or ethnic groups (e.g., “don’t trust White people”), and deference to other racial or ethnic groups (e.g., “Whites are better than Blacks”). The lessons that Black adolescents and college students found to be the most useful, however, were those that emphasized pride and color blindness, such as “race doesn’t matter” and “with hard work, you can achieve anything regardless of race” (Lesane-Brown et al., 2005).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Race is socially constructed, as we shall see in <a href="part0071_split_000.html#23MNU0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 11</a>, so the experiences of racial minorities and understandings of race change across time and space. Given tremendous changes in the opportunities facing Black Americans throughout the twentieth century and dramatic declines in levels of racism, have the messages that Black parents transmit to their children changed over time? In a 2006 study, Brown and Lesane-Brown examined data from a sample of Black Americans ages 17 to 101 in 1980. The subjects were asked about the racial lessons they had learned from their parents. Specifically, they were given the question: “When you were a child, were there things your parents or the people that raised you taught you to help you know what it is to be Black?” If respondents answered yes, they were asked the open-ended question, “What are the most important things they did or told you?” The researchers also classified people based on the time period in which they turned age 16 to explore the ways that historical context might have shaped their early socialization experiences. Subjects were classified based on whether they came of age pre–<i class="italic">Brown v. Board of Education</i> (before 1957), during the era of civil rights protests (1957–1968), or after the peak of the civil rights protests (1969–1980).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Brown and Lesane-Brown (2006) identified five main themes from their open-ended questions. The messages of racial socialization were individual pride, racial-group pride, deference to and fear of Whites, color blindness, and the belief that Whites are prejudiced. However, the frequency with which these themes were mentioned varied across generations. Black parents were more likely to transmit messages about deference to and fear of Whites during periods of blatant racial segregation and legalized brutality (pre–<i class="italic">Brown v. Board of Education</i> birth cohort). Although the researchers expected that parents would transmit more “color-blind” messages to their children in the later post–civil rights era, they did not find support for their hypothesis. Rather, messages of racial equality were more frequently transmitted to children during the early pre–<i class="italic">Brown v. Board of Education</i> era; the researchers concluded that Black parents may feel particularly compelled to assert that all groups are equal during the historical period when that assertion was contested most passionately by Whites.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What are the consequences of race socialization? Brown and Lesane-Brown (2006) found that the messages one receives during childhood have far-reaching implications for one’s political attitudes and behaviors, including whether one supports voting for Black candidates and whether one believes that Blacks and Whites have the same chance to get ahead with respect to work and education. In other research, these scholars found that ethnic/race socialization is linked with better academic performance in elementary school. Interestingly, they found a curvilinear association, meaning that the positive <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_123" title="123"></span>effects of race socialization were most evident among children who had received moderately frequent messages; the positive effects were less evident among those who had parent-child conversations about their racial background either very frequently or very infrequently (Brown, Tanner-Smith, and Lesane-Brown, 2009).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Understanding race socialization will become increasingly important for future cohorts of young people. In our rapidly globalizing society, children and young people will need to develop the skills and capacities to negotiate multicultural contexts in their everyday lives (Priest et al., 2014). Children of all ethnic and racial backgrounds will require the skills and attitudes to think positively about racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity. Parents, teachers, and other agents of socialization must also promote positive racial attitudes, counter negative attitudes, and enable effective responses to racism when it occurs. Although race socialization historically has focused on raising Black children to fit in and get ahead in a racist world, scholars today recognize that White children, too, should be socialized to recognize and fight racism when they see it unfold (Priest et al., 2014).</p>
