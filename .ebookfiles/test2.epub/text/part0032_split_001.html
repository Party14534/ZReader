<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Are Gender Differences Caused by Social Influences?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many studies have examined the degree to which gender differences are the result of social influences. Studies of mother-infant interaction show differences in the treatment of boys and girls, even when parents believe their reactions to both are the same. Adults asked to assess the personality of a baby give different answers according to whether they believe the child is a girl or a boy. In one experiment, five young mothers were observed interacting with a six-month-old called Beth. They smiled at her often and offered her dolls to play with. She was seen as “sweet” and as having a “soft cry.” The reaction of a second group of mothers to a child the same age, named Adam, was noticeably different. They offered him a train or other “male” toys to play with. Beth and Adam were actually the same child, dressed in different clothes (Will, Self, and Datan, 1976).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Gender Learning</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Gender learning by infants is almost certainly unconscious. Before a child can label itself as either a boy or a girl, the child receives preverbal cues. For instance, male and female adults usually handle infants differently. Women’s cosmetics contain scents different from those the baby might associate with males. Systematic differences in dress, hairstyle, and so on provide visual cues for the infant in the learning process. By age two, children have a partial understanding of what gender is. They know whether they are boys or girls, and they can usually categorize others accurately. Not until age five or six, however, does a child know that a person’s sex does not change, that everyone has gender, and that sex differences between girls and boys are anatomically based.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Parents play a pivotal role in gender learning, often unintentionally. A child’s earliest exposure to what it means to be male or female comes from his or her parents. From the time their children are newborns, parents interact with their daughters and sons differently. They may dress their sons in blue and daughters in pink, or speak to girls in softer and gentler tones than they do with boys. One classic study found that parents have different expectations for their sons and daughters as early as one day after they are born, where infant girls are described as “soft” and “pretty” and boys as “energetic” and “strong” (Rubin, Provenzano, and Luria, 1974). It’s not surprising, then, that <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_125" title="125"></span>as children become toddlers, parents (especially fathers) engage in more rough-and-tumble play with boys and hold more give-and-take conversations with girls (Lytton and Romney, 1991).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Even parents who are sensitive to gender-equity issues and who challenge the notion of the male/female dichotomy may send subtle messages related to gender—messages that the developing child internalizes. Sex-role stereotypes and subtle messages about appropriate gender-typed behavior are so powerful that even when children are exposed to diverse attitudes and experiences, they may revert to stereotyped choices—especially in sociocultural and historical contexts that adhere to gender-typed social roles and expectations (Haslett, Geis, and Carter, 1992). Children may even deny the reality of what they are seeing when it doesn’t conform to their gender expectations. For instance, a child whose mother is a doctor may state that only men are doctors, and women are nurses (Sheldon, 1990).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Children’s toys and activities also tend to follow stereotypical patterns. Studies of children’s bedrooms in the contemporary United States consistently find that girls’ rooms have more pink decoration and more dolls, whereas boys’ rooms tend to have more blue tones, sports equipment, and vehicles (Pomerleau et al., 1990). A simple visit to a department store or a big-box store illustrates the dominance of gender stereotypes, as retailers typically categorize their products by gender. Even toys that seem gender neutral are not so in practice. Vanda Lucia Zammuner (1986) studied the toy preferences of children between 7 and 10 years of age in Italy and Holland; they included stereotypically masculine or feminine toys as well as toys presumed not to be gender-typed. The children and their parents were asked which toys were suitable for boys and which for girls. There was close agreement between the adults and the children. On average, the Italian children chose gender-differentiated toys more often than the Dutch children—a finding that conformed to expectations because Italian culture holds a more traditional view of gender divisions than does Dutch society. As in other studies, girls from both societies chose gender-neutral or boys’ toys far more often than boys chose girls’ toys.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">But these stark gender divides are historically bound. Cultural analyses have found that the “blue is for boys, pink is for girls” divide is a twentieth-century social construction. In the nineteenth century and early decades of the twentieth century, boys and girls wore similar colors, mostly white (Paoletti, 2012). However, in the post-war era in the United States, the pink-blue gender divide emerged, and persisted on and off throughout the late twentieth century. Yet the trend appears to be coming full circle, with retailers and shoppers alike abandoning this convention. For example, in 2015, Target, the nation’s largest retailer, stopped dividing its toy departments into “boy” and “girl” sections and also discontinued the pink- and blue-colored walls previously used to draw attention to gender-typed toys. Recognizing that nearly every product for children is gender-typed, Target management also stopped dividing up other departments, such as bedding, by gender. Boys and girls might be equally likely to want a Star Wars or a Dora the Explorer comforter (Luckerson, 2015). The move was triggered, in part, by shoppers’ concerns regarding the needless gender labeling of toys. Most famously, shopper Abi Bechtel noted a sign in Target’s toy section differentiating “building sets” and “girls’ building sets.” The notion that gender-neutral toys are healthy for all children is rapidly spreading, with more and more manufacturers abandoning gender-typed colors and designs of their toys.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Like children’s toys, children’s books and television shows teach important, though subtle, lessons about gender. In the 1970s, Lenore Weitzman and her colleagues analyzed gender roles in some of the most widely used preschool children’s books and found several clear differences in gender roles (Weitzman et al., 1972). Males played a much larger part in the stories and pictures than did females: they outnumbered females by a ratio of 11 to 1. When animals with gender identities were included, the ratio was 95 to 1. The activities of males and females also differed. The males engaged in adventurous pursuits and outdoor activities demanding independence and strength. When girls did appear, they were portrayed as passive and were confined mostly to indoor activities. Girls cooked and cleaned for the males or awaited their return. Much the same was true of the adult characters. Women who were not wives and mothers were imaginary creatures such as witches and fairy godmothers. In all the books analyzed, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_127" title="127"></span>not a single woman held an occupation outside the home. By contrast, the men were depicted as fighters, policemen, judges, kings, and so forth.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">More recent research suggests a slight change but notes that the bulk of children’s literature remains the same (McCabe et al., 2011). Children’s books feature many more men and boys as lead characters than women and girls. Even when characters are animals, they tend to be male (McCabe et al., 2011). The specific messages conveyed in children’s books are often quite traditional as well. Fairy tales, for example, still embody traditional attitudes toward gender and expectations for boys’ and girls’ ambitions. In versions of fairy tales from several centuries ago, the idea that “someday my prince will come” usually implied that a girl from a poor family might dream of wealth and fortune. Today that notion is tied to the ideals of romantic love. Some observers have noted that the popular Disney movie <i class="italic">Frozen</i> is a small step toward chipping away at such stereotypes. The lead character, Anna, discovers that her “handsome prince” is actually a cruel liar. Anna goes on to find her happy ending when she reconnects with her estranged older sister, Elsa, although Anna does eventually find true love with her ruggedly handsome suitor, Kristoff the iceman (Guilford, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although there are exceptions, analyses of children’s television programs and video games match the findings about children’s books. In the most popular cartoons and games, most leading figures are male, and males dominate the active pursuits (Leaper and Bigler, 2018). Similar images appear in the commercials advertising children’s foods and toys. For instance, researchers recently examined the ways that boys and girls are portrayed in children’s programming on three networks: the Disney Channel, Cartoon Network, and Nickelodeon (Hentges and Case, 2013). Boy characters outnumbered girls 3 to 2, and there was some evidence that characters were depicted behaving in stereotypical ways, where boys were more likely to be aggressive “rescuers” and girls were more likely to show affection.</p>
