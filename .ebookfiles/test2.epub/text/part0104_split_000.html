<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When we think of education, we tend to see it from an individual perspective. We may think of our own reasons for attending college: to cultivate our intelligence, enjoy a fun and social “college experience,” or prepare for a career. We also tend to think of education as a means of upward mobility. But sociologists look beyond the individual student and his or her goals to connect these to the larger social functions of schools. We discuss three major sociological theories of the role schooling plays in the larger society: schooling as a process of assimilation or acculturation; schooling as a credentialing mechanism; and schooling as a process of social, or cultural, reproduction.</p>
