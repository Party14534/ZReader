Advances in technology, global supply chains, the information revolution, a revolution in shipping—all these are transforming the world at a pace unprecedented since the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As a result, the occupational structure in all industrialized countries has changed substantially since the beginning of the twentieth century, and the United States is no exception (Figure 14.4).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 1900, about three-quarters of the employed American population were in manual work, either farming or blue-collar work such as manufacturing. White-collar professional and service jobs were much fewer in number. By 1960, however, more people worked in white-collar professional and service jobs than in manual labor. By 1993, the occupational system had basically reversed its structure from 1900. Almost three-quarters of the employed population worked in white-collar professional and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_549" title="549"></span>service jobs, while the rest worked in blue-collar and farming jobs.

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The reasons for this shift, and how it will play out in terms of job opportunities for young people today, remain poorly understood. Perhaps because we are in the midst of such a significant transformation, there are disagreements over its causes and consequences.</p>
