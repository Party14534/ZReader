<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Discrimination on the basis of age, or <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-ageism" href="part0080_split_008.html#ageism">ageism</a>, is prohibited by federal law. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) protects job applicants and employees 40 years of age and older from discrimination on the basis of age in hiring, firing, promotion, and pay. Nonetheless, prejudices based on false stereotypes are common. Older adults are frequently seen <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_438" title="438"></span>as lonely, sad, frail, forgetful, dependent, senile, old-fashioned, inflexible, and embittered (Palmore, 2015). Ageism intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, as “old age” became viewed as synonymous with sickness and death. However, epidemiologists and medical professionals are quick to point out that the most serious risk factor for the virus is underlying conditions. A 45-year-old who suffers from high blood pressure, asthma, and type 2 diabetes may be at greater risk than a healthy 72-year-old.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are a number of reasons for such prejudice. Americans’ obsession with youthful beauty and vigor, reflected in popular entertainment and advertising, leads many younger people to disparage their elders, frequently dismissing them as irrelevant. Associated with the emphasis on youthfulness is a fear-filled avoidance of reminders of death and dying. Such fear carries over into negative attitudes toward older persons, who serve as a constant reminder of one’s mortality (Fry, 1980). The information-technology culture undoubtedly reinforces these prejudices because youthfulness and computer abilities seem to go hand in hand. In the fast-paced world of Twitter and Snapchat, young people may come to view older persons as anachronistic. Over the past decade, a new stereotype has emerged; that older adults are “greedy geezers” who are relying on Social Security benefits they don’t need, and in the process robbing Generation X of a secure financial future (Street and Cossman, 2006).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These stereotypes are false, yet they can also do harm in several ways. First, merely believing negative stereotypes about aging can take a toll on the health and longevity of older adults. Becca Levy (2002) and her colleagues asked a sample of older adults how much they agreed or disagreed with statements such as “As you get older, you are less useful.” When researchers followed up with the study participants 10 years later, they found that 87 percent of those with positive attitudes, yet just 66 percent of those with negative attitudes, were still alive. The pattern was even more pronounced at the 22-year follow-up, when 50 percent of those with positive attitudes, yet just 27 percent of those with negative attitudes, were still alive. Even after statistically controlling for possible explanatory pathways, such as health, socioeconomic status, and health behaviors, these patterns persisted, suggesting that harmful beliefs can exact a physical toll, although researchers are not certain as to why.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Second, older adults can be harmed if other people’s ageist beliefs are translated into discriminatory treatment. For example, one recent study found that nearly two-thirds of older adults reported that they had been the victim of ageism, with their experiences ranging from minor slights, such as being treated as if they were not smart or receiving poor service at a restaurant, to more serious experiences, such as job or health care discrimination. Moreover, those persons who had experienced such mistreatment later experienced poorer physical and mental health than their peers who had not been victimized (Luo et al., 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">If ageist stereotypes are so harmful, why do they persist? Age-based stereotypes, like all stereotypes, have a kernel of truth (LeVine and Campbell, 1972). Prior cohorts of older adults often were less vigorous, healthy, financially well-off, integrated into society, and technologically savvy than both their younger counterparts and current cohorts of older adults. These patterns are less a reflection of older persons themselves than of society’s failure to afford equal opportunities to older adults. Current cohorts of older adults, by contrast, are healthier, more integrated into society, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_439" title="439"></span>technologically savvier than ever before. These patterns, in turn, may start to chip away at outdated and inaccurate notions of what old age is. Consider that Oscar-winner actor Tom Hanks graced the cover of <i class="italic">AARP</i> magazine in 2019, the year he turned 63. Hanks is three years younger than 66-year-old luminary Oprah Winfrey, who is four years younger than septuagenarian Bruce Springsteen, who turned 71 in 2020.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Just as older adults are a vital part of popular culture, they are becoming an increasingly large presence online. In 2016, 64 percent of older Americans were using the Internet and more than a third were using social media (Pew Research Center, 2017a). Experts agree that baby boomers may play a critical role in further helping to dissolve stereotypes of the frail, out-of-it older adult.</p>
