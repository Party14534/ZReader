<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-evangelicalism" href="part0112_split_004.html#evangelicalism">Evangelicalism</a>, a belief in spiritual rebirth (being “born again”), is a response to growing secularism, religious diversity, and the decline of once-core Protestant values in public life (Wuthnow, 1988, 1990). The late-twentieth-century growth in evangelical denominations in the United States appears to have slowed or even declined slightly; while the number of evangelical Christians has expanded with the U.S. population, it has declined slightly as a percentage of the total population, although mainstream Protestant religious affiliations have experienced more significant declines (Pew Research Center, 2015g). Some Protestants are seeking the more direct, personal, and emotional religious experience evangelical denominations promise.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although some evangelicals combine a modern lifestyle with traditional religious beliefs, others strongly reject many aspects of <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_696" title="696"></span>contemporary life. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-fundamentalists" href="part0112_split_004.html#fundamentalists">Fundamentalists</a> are evangelicals who are antimodern, calling for strict codes of morality and conduct. These frequently include taboos against drinking, smoking, and other “worldly evils,” a belief in biblical infallibility, and a strong emphasis on Christ’s impending return to earth (Balmer, 1989).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Evangelicalism is fastest growing in the global south, where the number of evangelicals is now estimated to be greater than in the global north. North America—the United States and Canada—now accounts for fewer than one out of every five evangelicals in the world.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Evangelical organizations have been especially effective at mobilizing resources to achieve their religious and political objectives. They have become extremely competitive “spiritual entrepreneurs” in the “religious marketplace” (Hatch, 1989). Some evangelicals use radio and television as marketing technologies to reach a wider audience, although the heyday of “televangelists”—preachers with huge television audiences who preached a “gospel of prosperity”—appears to have peaked. Still, the current large <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_697" title="697"></span>number of religious television networks includes the Christian Broadcasting Network, the Eternal Word Television Network, the Trinity Broadcasting Network, Sky Angel Faith and Family Television, and FamilyNet. Some scholars argue that these ministries are stronger today than ever before (Hadden, 2004). The 2010 U.S. Census reported that the number of people who self-identify as belonging to denominations that would be classified as evangelical grew from roughly 42 million in 1990 to 45 million in 2001, to 49 million in 2008. The Pew Research Center puts the current number of evangelical Protestants at around 54 million, or one in five U.S. adults (Pew Research Center, 2015c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The growth of evangelicalism may have peaked in the United States, but it is growing rapidly throughout the world, spurred by evangelical missionary zeal (Figure 17.1). In a 2011 survey of nearly 2,200 evangelical leaders throughout the world, only 44 percent of those who lived in the United States, Europe, and other advanced industrial countries expected that the state of evangelical Christianity in their countries would be better in five years than it is today; 33 percent expected it to be worse. U.S. evangelical leaders are the most pessimistic, with nearly half (48 percent) expecting things to be worse in five years, compared with only 31 percent who expected things to be better. By way of contrast, those who lived in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and parts of Asia were overwhelmingly optimistic about the future: 71 percent expected the state of evangelical Christianity to be better, while only 12 percent expected it to be worse. When asked about the principal threats to evangelical Christianity, 71 percent of the global evangelical leaders—including 92 percent of U.S. leaders—cited the influence of secularism (Pew Research Center, 2011b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 2010, 8 out of 10 White evangelical Protestants believed that religion’s influence on U.S. politics and government leaders was declining. Almost all saw this decline as a bad thing—and while fewer than 1 in 5 viewed the Democratic Party as friendly to religion, slightly more than half viewed the Republican Party favorably (Pew Research Center, 2011b). The Tea Party movement, discussed in <a href="part0083_split_000.html#2F4UM0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 13</a>, represents an effort by political conservatives, many with strong religious roots, to exert influence through a Republican Party that more closely reflects their views. White evangelical Protestants have become a core constituency of the Republican Party, whose program reflects fundamentalist religious beliefs on such topics as opposition to abortion and a reduced role for government in the economy. As of 2016, White evangelical Protestants tied most to the Republican Party than any other religious group. Forty-nine percent of White evangelical Protestants identify with the Republican Party, another 31 percent identify as independent, and 14 percent identify with the Democratic Party (Cox, 2017).</p>
