<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Interactional Vandalism</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Conversations are one of the main ways in which our daily lives are maintained in a stable and coherent manner. We feel most comfortable when the tacit conventions of small talk are adhered to; when they are breached, we can feel threatened, confused, and insecure. In most everyday talk, conversants are carefully attuned to the cues they <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_151" title="151"></span>get from others—such as changes in intonation, slight pauses, or gestures—to facilitate smooth conversation. By being mutually aware, conversants “cooperate” in opening and closing interactions and in taking turns to speak. Interactions in which one party is conversationally “uncooperative,” however, can give rise to tensions.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Garfinkel’s students created tense situations by intentionally undermining conversational rules as part of a sociological experiment. But what about situations in the real world in which people make trouble through their conversational practices? One study investigated verbal interchanges between pedestrians and street people in New York City to understand why passersby so often see such interactions as problematic. The researchers used a technique called conversation analysis to compare a selection of street interchanges with samples of everyday talk. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-conversation-analysis" href="part0037_split_004.html#conversation-analysis">Conversation analysis</a> is a methodology that examines all facets of a conversation for meaning—from the smallest filler words (such as <i class="italic">um</i> and <i class="italic">ah</i>) to the precise timing of interchanges (including pauses, interruptions, and overlap).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The study looked at interactions between Black men—many of whom were homeless or addicted to drugs or alcohol—and women who passed by them on the street. The men often tried to initiate conversations with passing women by calling out to them, paying them compliments, or asking them questions. But something “went wrong” in these conversations, because the women rarely responded as they would have in a normal interaction. Even though the men’s comments were rarely hostile in tone, the women tended to quicken their step and stare fixedly ahead. The following shows attempts by Mudrick, a Black man in his late fifties, to engage women in conversation (Duneier and Molotch, 1999):</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Mudrick begins this interaction when a White woman who looks about twenty-five approaches at a steady pace:</p>
<ol class="fmnl">
<li class="bcpt" value="1"><i class="italic">Mudrick: I love you, baby.</i></li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">She crosses her arms and quickens her walk, ignoring the comment.</p>
<ol class="fmnl" start="2">
<li class="bcpt" value="2"><i class="italic">Mudrick: Marry me.</i></li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Next, it is two White women, also probably in their mid-twenties:</p>
<ol class="fmnl" start="3">
<li class="bcpt" value="3"><i class="italic">Mudrick: Hi, girls, you all look very nice today. You have some money? Buy some books.</i></li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">They ignore him. Next, it is a young Black woman.</p>
<ol class="fmnl" start="4">
<li class="bcpt" value="4"><i class="italic">Mudrick: Hey, pretty. Hey, pretty.</i></li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">She keeps walking without acknowledging him.</p>
<ol class="fmnl" start="5">
<li class="bcpt" value="5"><i class="italic">Mudrick: ’Scuse me. ’Scuse me. I know you hear me.</i></li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Then he addresses a White woman in her thirties.</p>
<ol class="fmnl" start="6">
<li class="bcpt" value="6"><i class="italic">Mudrick: I’m watching you. You look nice, you know.</i></li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">She ignores him.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Negotiating smooth “openings” and “closings” to conversations is a fundamental requirement for urban civility. These crucial aspects of conversation were highly problematic between the men and women in this study. Where the women resisted the men’s attempts at opening conversations, the men ignored the women’s resistance and persisted. Similarly, if the men succeeded in opening a conversation, they often <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_152" title="152"></span>refused to respond to cues from the women to close the conversation once it had gotten underway (Duneier and Molotch, 1999):</p>
<ol class="fmnl" start="1">
<li class="bcpt" value="1"><i class="italic">Mudrick: Hey, pretty.</i></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="2"><i class="italic">Woman: Hi, how you doin’?</i></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="3"><i class="italic">Mudrick: You alright?</i></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="4"><i class="italic">Mudrick: You look very nice, you know. I like how you have your hair pinned.</i></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="5"><i class="italic">Mudrick: You married?</i></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="6"><i class="italic">Woman: Yeah.</i></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="7"><i class="italic">Mudrick: Huh?</i></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="8"><i class="italic">Woman: Yeah.</i></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="9"><i class="italic">Mudrick: Where the rings at?</i></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="10"><i class="italic">Woman: I have it home.</i></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="11"><i class="italic">Mudrick: Y’ have it home?</i></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="12"><i class="italic">Woman: Yeah.</i></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="13"><i class="italic">Mudrick: Can I get your name?</i></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="14"><i class="italic">Mudrick: My name is Mudrick. What’s yours?</i></li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">She does not answer and walks on.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In this instance, Mudrick made 9 out of the 14 utterances in the interaction to initiate the conversation and to elicit further responses from the woman. From the transcript alone, it is quite evident that the woman is not interested in talking, but when conversation analysis is applied to the tape recording, her reluctance becomes even clearer. Even when she does respond, the woman delays all her responses, while Mudrick replies immediately, his comments sometimes overlapping hers. Timing in conversations is a very precise indicator; delaying a response by even a fraction of a second is adequate in most everyday interactions to signal the desire to change the course of a conversation. By betraying these tacit rules of sociability, Mudrick was practicing conversation in a way that was technically rude. The woman, in return, was also technically rude in ignoring Mudrick’s repeated attempts to engage her in talk. It is the technically rude nature of these street interchanges that make them problematic for passersby to handle. When standard cues for opening and closing conversations are not adhered to, individuals feel a sense of profound and inexplicable insecurity.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The term <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-interactional-vandalism" href="part0037_split_004.html#interactional-vandalism">interactional vandalism</a> describes cases like these in which a subordinate person breaks the tacit rules of everyday interaction that are of value to the more powerful person. The men on the street often do conform to everyday forms of speech in their interactions with one another, local shopkeepers, the police, relatives, and acquaintances. But when they choose to, they subvert the tacit conventions for everyday talk in a way that leaves passersby disoriented. Even more than physical assaults or vulgar verbal abuse, interactional vandalism leaves victims unable to articulate what has happened.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This study of interactional vandalism provides another example of the two-way links between micro-level interactions and forces that operate on the macro level. To the men on the street, the women who ignore their attempts at conversation appear distant, cold, and bereft of sympathy—legitimate “targets” for such interactions. The women, meanwhile, may often take the men’s behavior as proof that they are indeed dangerous and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_153" title="153"></span>best avoided. Interactional vandalism is closely tied up with overarching class, gender, and racial structures. The fear and anxiety generated in such mundane interactions help reinforce the outside statuses and forces that, in turn, influence the interactions themselves. Interactional vandalism is part of a self-reinforcing system of mutual suspicion and incivility.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Internet creates spaces in which less powerful people can make their superiors accountable in ways they never were before. Think of all the blogs in which workers talk anonymously about their bosses or situations in which workers forward rude messages from their boss to other employees. Because of the Internet, powerful people are less able to segregate their audiences—treating some people poorly behind the scenes and treating others very nicely in public.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The concept of “trolling” might be seen as an interactional mode that shares certain, though not all, aspects of interactional vandalism. A troll is a person who is anonymously disruptive of the taken-for-granted purposes of an online space such as a message board. As such, he or she might post deliberately provocative items. Such provocations might have the effect of undermining the civility that is a foundation for the kind of communication the site’s founders envisioned. Or the controversies raised by trolls can sometimes increase traffic to the site.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">To what extent is trolling an example of interactional vandalism of the kind found in face-to-face communication on the sidewalk? Like the poor Black men who act sincere as they pretend not to understand that a two-second pause is a signal to close a conversation, a troll will pretend not to understand certain assumptions of the conversational world for the specific purpose of being disruptive. Like the poor men on the street, the troll will write as if they are a sincere member of the group who perhaps does not understand certain things, while at a deeper level, they know precisely what they are doing.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some readers of a comment posted by a troll might be lured further into the interaction, while others will attempt to restore normal order by dismissing the troll’s actions. In interactional vandalism on the sidewalk, a less powerful person is subverting normal interaction to undermine the taken-for-granted control of someone in a superordinate position. In trolling, the parties are often anonymous, so it’s not always possible to know what the actual power dynamics are. Are the anonymous people, in fact, less powerful members, or could they be very well-known members of the community who are using the board to further their own agenda?</p>
