<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Agents of Socialization</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists often speak of socialization as occurring in two broad phases, involving numerous <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-agents-of-socialization" href="part0029_split_005.html#agents-of-socialization">agents of socialization</a>—that is, groups or social contexts in which significant processes of socialization occur. Primary socialization, which occurs in infancy and childhood, is the most intense period of cultural learning. It is the time when children learn language and basic behavioral patterns that form the foundation for later learning. The family is the main agent of socialization during this phase. Secondary socialization occurs later in childhood and in maturity. In this phase, other agents of socialization, such as schools, peer groups, organizations, the media, the workplace, religious organizations (as we discuss in <a href="part0108_split_000.html#36VSO0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 17</a>), and even the government become socializing forces.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Social interactions in these contexts help people learn (and unlearn) the values, norms, and beliefs of their culture. Importantly, socialization is a lifelong process and does not end in childhood. Additionally, socialization can be a process of learning, relearning, and unlearning. For instance, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-resocialization" href="part0029_split_005.html#resocialization">resocialization</a> refers to the process whereby people learn new rules and norms when entering a new social world. For instance, mild resocialization might occur if we move to a different nation and must learn a new language, customs, eating habits, and basic rules of etiquette, such as bowing rather than shaking hands with a new colleague. A more extreme form of resocialization may occur if we enter an institution such as the military or prison, where individuals often need to learn an entirely new set of rules, schedules, and modes of interacting with others. For instance, taken-for-granted freedoms, such as being able to snack whenever we want, are curtailed in highly structured settings like the military, where meals are scheduled and ritualized. Likewise, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-desocialization" href="part0029_split_005.html#desocialization">desocialization</a> entails unlearning rules and shedding the privileges associated with a particular role, such as an athlete who has retired from competitive sports.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Socialization can happen in the present, where we learn as we go, or it may occur far in advance of our adopting a social role or participating in a particular social world. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-anticipatory-socialization" href="part0029_split_005.html#anticipatory-socialization">Anticipatory socialization</a> refers to the process whereby <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_101" title="101"></span>we learn about what a particular role might entail before we enter it. For instance, parenting classes for pregnant women and their partners provide guidance that won’t be used for several months. Summer camps for high school students prepare young people to someday live away from home or at college, independent from one’s parents. As we shall soon see, many individuals and institutions—from parents to schools—play a critical role in the socialization process.</p>
<section id="families">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Families</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because family systems vary widely, the infant’s range of family contacts is not standard across cultures. The mother tends to be the most important individual in the child’s early life, but the nature of relationships between mothers and their children is influenced by the form and regularity of their contact. This, in turn, is conditioned by the character of family institutions and their relation to other groups in society.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In modern societies, most early socialization occurs within a small-scale family context. Most American children grow up within a domestic unit containing one or two parents and perhaps one or two other children. In many other cultures, by contrast, aunts, uncles, and grandparents are part of a single household and serve as caretakers even for very young infants. Even within U.S. society family contexts vary widely. Some children grow up in single-parent households; some have two mother figures and/or two father figures (divorced parents, stepparents, or same-sex parents). Many women with families work for pay outside the home and return to their paid work soon after the birth of their children. In spite of these variations, families normally remain the major agent of socialization from infancy to adolescence and beyond, in a sequence of development connecting the generations.</p>

</figure>
<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The centrality of family as an agent of socialization has changed throughout history. In most premodern societies, the family into which a person was born determined the individual’s lifelong social position. In modern societies, social position is not inherited at birth, yet the region and social class of the family have a distinct effect on patterns of socialization. Children pick up ways of behavior characteristic of their parents or others in their neighborhood or community. Varying patterns of child-rearing and discipline, together with contrasting values and expectations, are found in different sectors of large societies. For instance, sociologist Annette Lareau (2011) observed parents and children in their own homes and found that working-class parents and middle-class parents approach child-rearing in different ways. Working-class parents promote what Lareau refers to as the <i class="italic">accomplishment of natural growth;</i> their children enjoy long periods of unstructured free time, often spent with friends and extended family members. In contrast, upper-middle-class parents practice what <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_102" title="102"></span>Lareau calls <i class="italic">concerted cultivation</i>, actively fostering their kids’ talents by enrolling them in a range of structured educational and extracurricular activities and closely monitoring their development. This latter approach provides children with the opportunities and skills necessary not only to succeed in school and, later, in the workforce, but also to maintain their social-class position.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Of course, few of us unquestionably adopt our parents’ outlook. This is especially true in the modern world, where change is pervasive. Moreover, the very existence of a range of socializing agents in modern societies leads to divergences among the outlooks of children, adolescents, and parents.</p>
</section>
<section id="schools">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Schools</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Schools are another important socializing agent. Although schooling is a formal process, whereby students pursue a defined curriculum of subjects, schools are agents of socialization in more subtle respects. For instance, children must be punctual to class, stay quiet during lessons, and observe rules of discipline. They must accept the authority of the teaching staff. In some school systems, students say the Pledge of Allegiance to the American flag each morning and celebrate “Constitution Day” (Westheimer, 2007). This is also a way through which the government, another agent of socialization, instills in children cultural values such as patriotism. Teachers’ reactions affect the expectations children have of themselves, which in turn become linked to their job experience when they leave school. Peer groups are often formed at school, and the system of age-based classes reinforces their influence.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another key mechanism through which schools socialize children is the hidden curriculum; the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-hidden-curriculum" href="part0029_split_005.html#hidden-curriculum">hidden curriculum</a> refers to the subtle ways that boys, girls, and those who do not identify as a single gender, middle class versus working class, and Black versus White are exposed to different messages and curricular materials from their teachers. In <a href="part0102_split_000.html#318PC0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 16</a>, we delve much more fully into the ways that schools socialize children, often unwittingly perpetuating race, class, and gender inequalities. For instance, think about the kind of classes you and your fellow students took in high school. You might have found that students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds were “tracked” into classes like automotive repair, whereas wealthier classmates were channeled into college-prep classes (Oakes and Guiton, 1995). Likewise, boys historically were encouraged to take advanced science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) classes, whereas girls were not (Basow, 2004). These patterns have changed in the past decade, and girls are now enrolled in high-level high school math and science courses like calculus, algebra, and chemistry at the same rate as their male classmates, with the exception of computer science and engineering (National Science Foundation, 2018). In this way, schools have perpetuated the status quo, including social inequalities.</p>

<section id="peer-relationships">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Peer Relationships</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-peer-group" href="part0029_split_005.html#peer-group">peer group</a> consists of individuals of a similar age. In some cultures, particularly small, traditional societies, peer groups are <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_103" title="103"></span>formalized as <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-age-grade" href="part0029_split_005.html#age-grade">age-grades</a> (normally confined to males), with ceremonies or rites that mark the transition from one age-grade to another. Those within a particular age-grade generally maintain close connections throughout their lives. Peers may experience rites of passages together, such as kindergarten graduation, religious rites like <i class="italic">bar</i> or <i class="italic">bat mitzvahs</i> and confirmation, or drivers’ ed or SAT prep. These events are developmental markers and are also experiences that build feelings of unity among peers.</p>
<figure class="figure--fullwidth" data-figure-id="ch04ph02"><a data-href="../images/Ch04ph02.jpg" tabindex="0" data-size="2000x1376"><img class="figure__image" alt="" src="../images/00041.jpeg" data-image-id="ch04ph02"/></a>
<figcaption class="figure__caption">Children construct gender meanings through the games they play with their peers.</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although the family’s importance in socialization is obvious, it is less apparent, especially in Western societies, how significant peer groups are. Yet even without formal age-grades, children over the age of four or five usually spend a great deal of time in the company of friends who are the same age. Given the high proportion of working parents whose children play together in day-care centers, peer relations are even more important today than before (Corsaro, 1997; Harris, 1998).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In her classic book <i class="italic">Gender Play</i> (1993), sociologist Barrie Thorne explores how children learn what it means to be male or female. (You will learn three classic theories of gender socialization later in this chapter.) Rather than seeing children as passively learning the meaning of gender from their parents and teachers, Thorne examines how children actively create and re-create the meaning of gender in their interactions with one another. The social activities that schoolchildren do together can be as important as other agents for their socialization.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Thorne spent two years observing fourth- and fifth-graders at two schools in Michigan and California, sitting in the classroom with them and observing their activities outside the classroom. She watched games—such as “chase and kiss,” “cooties,” and “goin’ with,” as well as children teasing one another—to learn how children construct and experience gender meanings in the classroom and on the playground.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Thorne found that peer groups greatly influence gender socialization, particularly as children talk about their changing bodies. The social context determined whether a child’s bodily change was experienced with embarrassment or pride. As Thorne (1993) observed, “If the most popular girls started menstruating or wearing bras (even if they didn’t ‘need to’), then other girls wanted those changes too. But if the popular girls didn’t wear bras and hadn’t. . . gotten their periods, then these developments were seen as less desirable.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Peer relations have a significant effect beyond childhood and adolescence. Informal groups of people of similar ages, at work and in other situations, are usually of enduring importance in shaping individuals’ attitudes and behavior. Thorne’s research is a <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_104" title="104"></span>powerful reminder that children are social actors who help create their social world and influence their own socialization. Still, the effect of societal and cultural influences is also tremendous: Children’s activities and values are also determined by influences such as the media.</p>

<section id="mass-media-section">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_4">Mass Media</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Newspapers, periodicals, and journals flourished in the West from the early 1800s onward but had a limited readership. It was not until the early 1900s that such printed material became part of the daily experience of millions of people, influencing their attitudes and opinions. The spread of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-mass-media" href="part0029_split_005.html#mass-media">mass media</a> soon included electronic communication—radio, television, audio recordings, videos, and online communication, including social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Today, it is a rare American who goes a day (or even an hour) without reading an article, watching a video, or listening to a podcast online. In fact, more than 90 percent of teens go online at least once a day, while nearly a quarter (24 percent) use the Internet “almost constantly” (Lenhart, 2015). Fully 70 percent of all Americans and 86 percent of young adults (ages 18–29) use social media, with Facebook being the most widely used platform (Pew Research Center, 2017b). Young adults are also tethered to their smartphones. Nearly all (94 percent) adults between ages 18 and 24 own a smartphone, and they check their phones an average of 86 times a day. By contrast, the overall U.S. population ages 18 to 75 checks just 47 times a day (Deloitte, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Americans also spend a large portion of their leisure time consuming more traditional forms of media. According to the American Time Use Survey, Americans watched an average of nearly three hours of television per day in 2015, representing more than half of their total leisure time (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016a). However, in recent years smartphone use has surpassed television viewing, especially for young people. According to data from market research firm Nielsen, young adults ages 18 to 34 spend just under two hours per day watching live and time-shifted TV, yet 3.5 hours per day on the web or apps on their smartphone or tablets (Lee, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Media, in all its forms, has a powerful impact on our lives, and it is particularly influential in shaping the beliefs, behaviors, social interactions, and relationships of children, teens, and young adults. For instance, children and adolescents often model the gender roles and practices that they see on their favorite television shows. Fashion magazines, music videos, and more recently, social media’s fashion influencers are also cited as powerful influences on girls’ body image, or their beliefs about “ideal” body weight and physique (Fardouly and Vartanian, 2018; Grabe, Ward, and Hyde, 2008). Yet media can also teach children about topics with which their parents may be less familiar or comfortable, and can provide information and even a sense of solace for children who may be lacking support in their communities. For example, television shows like <i class="italic">I Am Jazz</i>, a reality show about the daily life of transgender teenager Jazz Jennings, has been praised for teaching messages of acceptance and providing a role model for children who may be conflicted about their own gender identity (<i class="italic">Time</i>, 2014). Trans youth also may use social media like Instagram to bolster and support fellow trans youth as they choose how to present themselves (Rutten, 2018).</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The study of the impact of media on youth is a critically important topic, with extensive research focused on the effect of television, film, popular music, and other media on propensities toward aggression and violence. Classic studies by George Gerbner (1986) and his collaborators analyzed samples of prime-time and weekend daytime TV for all major American networks each year for more than two decades dating back to 1967. They charted the number and frequency of violent acts and episodes for a range of programs, defining violence as physical force directed against the self or others by which physical harm or death occurs. Their database included observations on 2,816 television programs; they also coded 34,882 characters according to many thematic, demographic, and activity categories (Media Education Foundation, 1997). On average, 80 percent of programs contained violence, with a rate of 7.5 violent episodes per hour. Children’s programs showed even higher levels of violence, although killing was less common. Cartoons depict the highest number of violent acts and episodes of any type of television program (Gerbner et al., 1986). The level and number of media sources portraying extreme violence has only increased since that time, with video games, Internet displays, and cell phone displays showing graphic violence in games like <i class="italic">Grand Theft Auto, Fortnite,</i> and <i class="italic">Mortal Kombat</i> (Huesmann, 2007).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The reason these trends are troubling is that decades of research document that witnessing violence, whether in person, via a recorded image like a live-actor television show or movie, or even in cartoons, increases the chances that a child will behave aggressively. In a now-classic experiment by psychologist Albert Bandura, children watched an adult play with tinker toys and a Bobo doll (a five-foot-tall inflated plastic doll). In one condition, the adult began by assembling the tinker toys for about a minute and then turned his attention to the doll. He approached the doll, punched it, sat on it, hit it with a mallet, tossed it in the air, and kicked it around the room while shouting things such as “Hit him in the nose.” He did this for nine minutes while the child watched. Bandura had different versions of the experiment. In some cases, the child observed an actual actor; in another, the child witnessed a videotaped actor; and in a third, the child watched a cartoon version of the aggression. In the control-group condition, the actor worked with the tinker toys for the full 10-minute observation period. Relative to the control group, all three experimental groups of children subsequently engaged in more aggressive play, although a gradient emerged, where the effects of the actual actor were most powerful, followed by the videotaped actor and then the cartoon. Yet, in all three cases, the child imitated and acted out the aggressive play he or she had witnessed.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Given the powerful ways that violent media may socialize children into aggressive behaviors, researchers have become interested in studying how video games <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_106" title="106"></span>(especially violent video games) affect children. Nearly three-quarters of teenagers play video games on their phone, computer, or a console such as PlayStation, Xbox, or Wii, including 84 percent of teenage boys and 59 percent of teenage girls (Lenhart, 2015). Given what we’ve learned about socialization, is this a potentially harmful trend?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Researchers are finding that violent video games may affect youth in similar ways as violent television images. For instance, rapid-action games with very violent imagery may desensitize players to violence (Englehardt et al., 2011). Yet emerging research also shows that some video games can have positive effects on children and their families. Roughly 55 percent of parents believe that playing video games helps families spend more time together (Entertainment Software Association, 2014). Research carried out by an association of manufacturers of video games may be biased, so researchers have also carried out independent studies. Emerging research shows that some video games like Wii Fit can strengthen intergenerational relations, especially if grandchildren and grandparents play these games together (Costa and Veloso, 2016). And recent work by neuroscientists and psychologists finds that some types of fast-paced video games dubbed “brain games” boost children’s brain stimulation, cognitive development, spatial abilities, problem-solving skills, and even self-esteem (Granic, Lobel, and Engels, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Mass media is an important influence on socialization in all forms of society. Few societies in current times, even among more traditional cultures, remain untouched by the media (Huesmann, 2007). Electronic communication is accessible even to those who cannot read or write, and in the most impoverished parts of the world, it is common to find people owning radios, television sets, and smartphones. In this way, people throughout the globe are exposed not only to cultural messages from their own societies, but increasingly to cultural and media images from across the world—a topic we will explore more fully in <a href="part0127_split_000.html#3P3NE0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 20</a>.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As new technologies evolve, researchers will be particularly interested in documenting how they help and hurt. In the past decade or two, for instance, social scientists have documented the benefits and problems linked to excessive smartphone use. Many benefits have been documented, including helping people to stay in touch with friends and family far away, providing an easily accessible source of information and job opportunities, and even tracking one’s own health and fitness (Silver et al., 2019). However, other evidence suggests that smartphones prevent people from separating their personal and work lives, perpetuate a culture of round-the-clock work and responsiveness to work-related demands, and diminishing writing, emotional expression, and communication skills as smartphone users increasingly interact via terse text and instant messaging (Wagner, 2015).</p>

<section id="work">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_5">Work</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Work, in all cultures, is an important agent of socialization, although only in industrial societies do large numbers of people go to places of work separate from the home. In communities where people farmed nearby land or had workshops in their dwellings, work was not as distinct from other activities. In industrialized countries, joining the workforce ordinarily marks a much greater transition in an individual’s life than beginning work in traditional societies. Over the past two decades, however, rising numbers of workers carry out their jobs at home, fueled in part by email and the Internet, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_107" title="107"></span>although the overall numbers are still modest. About 5 percent of U.S. workers, numbering more than 8 million, worked exclusively at home in 2015—a steep increase over the 3 percent rate in 2000. As many as one in four do at least some paid work at home, with the option of working at home more common among professional and managerial workers (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016d).</p>
<figure class="figure--fullwidth" data-figure-id="ch04ph04"><a data-href="../images/Ch04ph04.jpg" tabindex="0" data-size="2400x1780"><img class="figure__image" alt="" src="../images/00043.jpeg" data-image-id="ch04ph04"/></a>
<figcaption class="figure__caption">Flight attendants, and other service workers, must learn to manage their emotions on the job. Arlie Hochschild referred to this as “emotion work.”</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The work environment often poses unfamiliar demands, perhaps calling for major adjustments in the person’s outlook or behavior. For example, when young people enter the workforce, they learn skills such as independence, self-efficacy, personal responsibility, responsibility for others, and how to develop effective relationships with nonfamily members (Greenberger and Steinberg, 1981). In addition to mastering the specific tasks of their job and internalizing cultural norms that guide appropriate professional behavior, many workers also need to learn how to “feel” on the job. Sociologists have explored in-depth how individuals learn to manage their emotions in the workplace, focusing on ways that workers learn to hide negative emotions so they can foster good relationships with customers or manage the emotional distress they feel when they encounter sad or gruesome experiences on the job. Sociologist Arlie Hochschild (1983) has documented the ways that workers, especially women workers, learn to feel and then display socially acceptable emotions at work. For instance, flight attendants learn to keep a calm and cool demeanor, even when dealing with a surly passenger or flying through extreme turbulence. Health-care workers, police officers, firefighters, and soldiers also must learn how to manage feelings such as fear, sadness, and disgust to do their job (e.g., Underman and Hirshfield, 2016). Schoolteachers and principals must remain calm and supportive, even when the children they work with act out (Maxwell and Riley, 2016). In these ways, individuals are socialized into the varied and complex skills they require to succeed in the workplace.</p>
