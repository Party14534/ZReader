<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The transformationalists take more of a middle position. Writers such as David Held and Anthony G. McGrew (Held et al., 1999) and Anthony Giddens, one of the authors of this textbook (1990), see globalization as the central force behind a broad spectrum of change. According to them, the global order is being transformed, but many of the old patterns remain. Governments, for instance, still retain a good deal of power in spite of global interdependence. These transformations are not restricted to economics but are equally prominent within politics, culture, and personal life. Transformationalists contend that the current level of globalization is breaking down established boundaries between internal and external, international and domestic. In adjusting to <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_829" title="829"></span>this new order, societies, institutions, and individuals must navigate contexts where previous structures have been shaken up.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Unlike hyperglobalizers, transformationalists see globalization as a dynamic and open process that is subject to influence and change. It is developing in a contradictory fashion, encompassing tendencies that frequently operate in opposition to one another. Globalization is a two-way flow of images, information, and influences. Global migration, media, and telecommunications are contributing to the diffusion of cultural influences. According to transformationalists, globalization is a decentered process characterized by links and cultural flows that work in a multidirectional way. Because globalization is the product of numerous intertwined global networks, it is not driven from one particular part of the world.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Rather than losing sovereignty, as the hyperglobalizers argue, countries are restructuring in response to new, nonterritorial forms of economic and social organization (e.g., corporations, social movements, and international bodies). Transformationalists argue that we are no longer living in a state-centric world; instead, governments must adopt a more active, outward-looking stance under the complex conditions of globalization (Cerny, 2005; Rosenau, 1997). In other words, nation-states remain relevant actors, but their function is changing. Globalization can perhaps be best understood as a tension between <i class="italic">inter</i>national (among nation-states) and <i class="italic">trans</i>national (borderless) social forces.</p>
