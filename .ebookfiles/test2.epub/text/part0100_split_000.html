<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As you have learned so far, family is an ever-evolving institution. As families change and new questions arise about these new forms, sociologists face the challenge of developing rigorous research to address these questions. Some of the most pressing questions facing family sociologists today focus on family forms that were once considered “nontraditional” or even “deviant,” such as cohabiting families, same-sex couples with children, and persons who choose to forgo marriage and live life on their own. Each of these fascinating groups has grown rapidly in number over the past half-decade, prompting sociologists to explore new and evolving questions.</p>
