<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">The Theory of Global Capitalism</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The emergence of giant transnational firms that operate in many countries and are loyal to none has given rise to a fourth theory, one that emphasizes the rising power of stateless corporations. The theory of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-global-capitalism" href="part0061_split_006.html#global-capitalism">global capitalism</a> argues that a transnational capitalist class is increasingly the major player in the global economy today, rather than the nationally oriented capitalists of major countries. According to this theory, we have entered a truly transnational phase of capitalism, characterized not only by global markets, production, and finance, but also by the emergence of a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-transnational-capitalist-class" href="part0061_split_006.html#transnational-capitalist-class">transnational capitalist class</a> whose business concerns are global rather than national. The foremost proponent of this theory, sociologist William Robinson (2004, 2014, 2017, 2019), argues that global dominance is no longer exercised by states, but rather by the transnational capitalist class. According to Robinson’s theory of global capitalism, the transnational capitalist class is more powerful than national capitalist classes; its global interests supersede any national loyalties. Its power is exerted in part through transnational organizations that oversee the global economy (for example, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank) and promote global business interests.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What makes the transnational capitalist class transnational, according to Robinson? First, as previously noted, its <i class="italic">economic interests are global</i> rather than national: the firms it serves have global shareholders, workers, and markets, and provide goods and services that are sourced globally. Second, members of the transnational capitalist class share a <i class="italic">globalizing perspective</i>: They believe in neoliberalism and free trade and oppose efforts of governments to regulate their activities, arguing instead that they can be trusted to enforce corporate codes of conduct that call for responsible labor practices and environmental policies. Third, they share <i class="italic">similar lifestyles</i>: they send their children to the same (private) schools, they belong to exclusive clubs where they can play golf together and share business ideas; they have multiple homes in desirable areas around the world; they travel in private jets to their many homes, offices and workplaces in different countries, and attend global elite gatherings such as the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Finally, they are <i class="italic">cosmopolitan</i>: Because of their similar lifestyles that span many countries, they see themselves as citizens of the world, rather than of any particular country.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologist Leslie Sklair (2000) has divided the transnational capitalist class into four different (but overlapping) “class fractions:” a <i class="italic">corporate fraction</i> that owns and controls the major transnational corporations; a <i class="italic">state fraction</i> composed of the bureaucrats and politicians who staff transnational organizations; a <i class="italic">technical fraction</i> consisting of the lawyers, accountants, engineers, and other professionals who work for transnational corporations; and a <i class="italic">consumerist fraction</i> consisting of merchants, advertising media, and marketing specialists who sell the products. It is important to recognize that the transnational capitalist class operates not only in the economic sphere, but also politically (through its ability to shape national policies to better serve its global interests) and culturally (by fostering a global belief in the value of consumerism).</p>
