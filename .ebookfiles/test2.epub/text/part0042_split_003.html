<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">The Effects of Size</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another significant way in which groups differ has to do with their size. Sociological interest in group size can be traced to Georg Simmel (1858–1918), a German sociologist <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_177" title="177"></span>who studied and theorized about the impact of small groups on people’s behavior. Since Simmel’s time, small-group researchers have examined the effects of size on both the quality of interaction in the group and the effectiveness of the group in accomplishing certain tasks (Bales, 1953, 1970; Homans, 1950; Mills, 1967).</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption"><i class="italic">The larger the number of people, the greater the possible number of relationships. Note that this figure illustrates only dyads; if triads and more complex coalitions were to be included, the numbers would be still greater (4 people yield 10 possibilities). Even a 10-person group can produce 45 possible dyads!</i></figcaption>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The simplest group, which Simmel (1955) called a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-dyad" href="part0042_split_005.html#dyad">dyad</a>, consists of two people. Simmel reasoned that dyads, which involve both intimacy and conflict, are likely to be simultaneously intense and unstable. To survive, they require the full attention and cooperation of both parties. If one person withdraws from the dyad, it vanishes. Dyads are typically the source of our most elementary social bonds, often constituting the group in which we are likely to share our deepest secrets. But dyads can be fragile. That is why, Simmel believed, numerous cultural and legal supports for marriage—an example of a dyad—are found in societies in which marriage is regarded as an important source of social stability.</p>

<section id="triads">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Triads</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Adding a third person changes the group relationship. Simmel used the term <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-triad" href="part0042_split_005.html#triad">triad</a> to describe a group of three people. Triads tend to be more stable than dyads because the presence of a third person relieves some of the pressure on the other two members to always get along and energize the relationship. In a triad, one person can temporarily withdraw attention from the relationship without necessarily threatening it. In addition, if two of the members have a disagreement, the third can play the role of mediator, as when you try to patch up a falling-out between two of your friends.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">On the other hand, alliances (sometimes termed <i class="italic">coalitions</i>) may form between two members of a triad, enabling them to gang up on the third and thereby destabilize the group. Alliances are most likely to form when no one member is clearly dominant and when all <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_178" title="178"></span>three members are competing for the same thing—for example, when three friends are given a pair of tickets to a concert and have to decide which two will go. The TV series <i class="italic">Survivor</i> provides many examples of alliance formation, as the program’s characters forge special relationships with one another to avoid being eliminated in the weekly group vote. In forming an alliance, a member of a triad is most likely to choose the weaker of the two other members as a partner, if there is one. In what have been termed <i class="italic">revolutionary coalitions</i>, the two weaker members form an alliance to overthrow the stronger one (Caplow, 1956, 1959, 1969).</p>

<section id="larger-groups">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Larger Groups</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Going from a dyad to a triad illustrates an important sociological principle first identified by Simmel: In most cases, as groups grow in size, their intensity decreases while their stability and exclusivity increase. Larger groups have less intense interactions, simply because a larger number of potential smaller group relationships exist as outlets for individuals who are not getting along with other members of the group. In a dyad, only one relationship is possible; in a triad, three different two-person relationships can occur. Adding a fourth person leads to six possible two-person relationships, in addition to potential subgroups of three. In a 10-person group, the number of possible two-person relationships explodes to 45 (Figure 6.2)! When one relationship doesn’t work out, you can easily move to another, as you probably often do at large parties.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">At the same time, larger groups tend to be more stable than smaller ones because they can survive the withdrawal of some members. A marriage or romantic relationship falls apart if one person leaves, whereas an athletic team or drama club routinely survives, though it may temporarily suffer from the loss of its graduating seniors.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Larger groups also tend to be more exclusive because it is easier for members to limit social relationships to the group itself and to avoid relationships with nonmembers. This sense of being part of an in-group, or clique, is sometimes found in fraternities, sororities, and other campus organizations. Cliquishness is especially likely to occur when a group’s members are similar in such social characteristics as age, gender, class, race, or ethnicity. People from rich families, for example, may be reluctant to fraternize with working-class groups, men may prefer to go to the basketball court with other men, and students who belong to a particular ethnic group (for example, African Americans, Latinos, or Asian Americans) may seek out one another in the dorm or cafeteria. Even so, groups do not always restrict relationships with outsiders. A group with a socially diverse membership is likely to foster a high degree of interaction with people outside the group (Blau, 1977). For example, if your social group or club has members from different social classes or ethnic groups, you are more likely to appreciate such social differences from firsthand experience and seek them out in other aspects of your life.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Beyond a certain size (perhaps a dozen people), groups tend to develop a formal structure. Formal leadership roles may arise, such as president or secretary, and official rules may be developed to govern what the group does.</p>
