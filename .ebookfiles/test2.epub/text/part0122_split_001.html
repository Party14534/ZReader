<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Population Analysis: Demography</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we saw in the opening discussion, the human population has exploded over the last few centuries. It is important to understand the dynamics of population growth because when it comes to the effect of humans on the planet, numbers matter.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Given the importance of understanding the dynamics and effects of human population growth, an entire field has emerged to study it scientifically: <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-demography" href="part0122_split_003.html#demography">demography</a>. The term has its roots in ancient Greek: <i class="italic">demos</i> (the people) and <i class="italic">graphos</i> (writing, recording). It was invented about a century and a half ago, at a time when nations were beginning to keep official statistics on the size of their populations, in an effort to explain population growth, decline, and geographical distribution. As we shall see, such population dynamics are governed by three factors: births, deaths, and migrations. Demography is therefore often treated as a branch of sociology because these factors are largely social and cultural in nature.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Much demographic work tends to be statistical, relying on large-sample surveys as well as on official birth and death records. Virtually all countries in the world today gather and analyze basic statistics on their entire populations by carrying out systematic surveys called censuses. Although every effort is made to count each and every person, censuses still are not 100 percent accurate, nor is every individual adequately represented. In the United States, for example, a comprehensive population census every 10 years (the decennial census) is mandated by the Constitution, and sample surveys are also regularly conducted. Yet many people are not counted in the official population statistics, including undocumented immigrants, homeless people, transients, and others who, for one reason or another, either did not complete their surveys or were not located by census takers. In many countries in the global south, particularly those with recent high rates of population growth, demographic statistics are much more unreliable.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_764" title="764"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Among the basic concepts demographers use, the most important are crude birthrates, fertility, and crude death rates. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-crude-birthrates" href="part0122_split_003.html#crude-birthrates">Crude birthrates</a> are expressed as the number of live births per year per 1,000 persons in the entire population. They are called “crude” rates because they do not focus on women of childbearing age, which is a much better predictor of population growth: A population with a high percentage of young women can be expected to have a much higher birthrate than one in which older men predominate. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-age-specific" href="part0122_split_003.html#age-specific">Age-specific birth rates</a> take into account such differences: for instance, the number of births per 1,000 women in the 25- to 34-year-old age group.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Crude birthrates are useful for making overall comparisons among different groups, societies, and regions. The crude birthrate for the world as a whole in 2019 was 19 per 1,000. For the United States, it was far lower, at 13 per 1,000. Other industrialized countries had even lower rates: for example, 9 per 1,000 in Germany and Italy, and 8 per 1,000 in Japan. In many other parts of the world, crude birthrates were much higher. In India, for instance, the crude birthrate was 18 per 1,000, and in many African nations, it was more than 40 per 1,000. The crude birth rates in Angola, Niger, and Mali—44 per 1,000—were the world’s highest in 2019 (World Population Review, 2019a). In fact, the crude birth rate for low-income countries as a whole (35 per 1,000) is more than three times that of high-income countries (11 per 1,000), making the poorest countries the fastest-growing, with the youngest populations (World Bank, 2019a).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is important to note that for the world as a whole, the crude birthrate has declined considerably over the past half century—from 36 per 1,000 in 1963 to 19 today. While fewer births suggests lower population growth and therefore reduced pressure on the environment, as we shall see below, declining global birthrates by themselves will not solve our environmental problems. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-fertility" href="part0122_split_003.html#fertility">Fertility</a> refers to how many live-born children the average woman actually has, in contrast to the number that are biologically possible. (Social and cultural factors, including birth control practices, play a role in determining actual fertility.) A fertility rate is usually calculated as the average number of births per 1,000 women of childbearing age.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-crude-death-rates" href="part0122_split_003.html#crude-death-rates">Crude death rates</a> (also called “mortality rates”) are calculated in the same way as birthrates—the number of deaths per 1,000 of the population per year. Again, there are major variations among countries, but death rates in many societies in the global south are falling to levels comparable to those of the West. The crude death rate for the world as a whole was 8 per 1,000 in 2019—a rate shared by many countries throughout the world, including Canada, Argentina, and some African countries such as Burundi and Zimbabwe. (Perhaps surprisingly, the United States crude death rate, 9 per 1,000, is slightly higher than the world average.) Both India and China had slightly lower crude death rates (7 per 1,000). At the other extreme, Bulgaria, Lesotho, and Serbia have the highest crude death rates, at 15 to 16 per 1,000. A high crude death rate can <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_765" title="765"></span>result from many factors, with poverty—and the poor health care that often goes along with it—being a major cause. But HIV/AIDS, warfare, drugs (such as opioids in the United States) and natural disasters also play a role. Crude death rates globally have fallen even more significantly than crude birth rates over the past half century, from 18 per 1,000 in 1960 to 8 per 1,000 today (World Bank, 2019b). While declining global mortality is obviously good news from the standpoint of public health (and personal suffering), there is one downside: Since global population growth necessarily results from the difference between births and deaths, the fact that the number of deaths has declined even more than the number of births is the reason that the world’s population continues to grow, with resulting pressures on the environment.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Like crude birthrates, crude death rates provide only a very general index of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-mortality" href="part0122_split_003.html#mortality">mortality</a> (the number of deaths in a population), and can be very misleading, since they do not reflect the age structure of a country: A country with an aging population will obviously have a higher mortality rate than a country with a younger population. For example, mortality rates in the European Union (10 per 1,000) are twice that in the Middle East and North Africa (5 per 1,000), even though the former is wealthier (and therefore healthier) than the latter. The reason: Europe has four times as many people over 65 (20 percent) than the Middle East and North Africa (5 percent) (World Bank, 2019b, 2019i).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A particularly important specific death rate is the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-infant-mortality-rate" href="part0122_split_003.html#infant-mortality-rate">infant mortality rate</a>—the number of babies per 1,000 births in any year who die before reaching age one. One of the key factors underlying the population explosion has been the reduction in infant mortality rates. For the world as a whole, in 2018, out of every 1,000 births, 29 babies died in infancy, a significant drop over barely three decades (as recently as 1990 the rate was 65). Infant mortality ranged from a low of 1to 2 per 1,000 in countries such as Norway, Sweden, and Finland, three Scandinavian countries with strong public health care systems, to a high of 85 in war-torn Central African Republic. The infant mortality rate in the United States—6 per 1,000—is at the low end, but not as low as high-income countries as a whole, or, for that matter, Cuba (both are 4 per 1,000) (World Bank, 2019f). Although Cuba is a poor (and undemocratic) country, its government has made preventive medicine, including a strong primary health care system, one of its top priorities (MEDICC, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Declining rates of infant mortality are the most important influence on increasing <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-life-expectancy" href="part0122_split_003.html#life-expectancy">life expectancy</a>—that is, the number of years the average person can expect to live. In 1900, life expectancy at birth in the United States was about 40 years. Today, it has increased to nearly 79 years (World Population Review, 2019b). This does not mean, however, that most people at the turn of the century died when they were about 40 years of age. If we look at the life expectancy of those people who survive the first year of life, we find that in 1900, the average person could expect to live to age 58. Illness, nutrition, and natural disasters are the other factors influencing life expectancy. Life expectancy has to be distinguished from <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-life-span" href="part0122_split_003.html#life-span">life span</a>, which is the maximum number of years that an individual could live. Although <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_766" title="766"></span>life expectancy has increased in most societies in the world, life span has remained unaltered. Only a small proportion of people live to be 100 or more.</p>
