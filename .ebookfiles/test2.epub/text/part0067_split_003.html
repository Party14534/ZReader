<dt id="keyterm-feminist-theory" class="calibre10"><a role="doc-backlink" href="part0067_split_002.html#refover-feminist-theory">feminist theory</a></dt>
<dd role="definition" id="feminist-theory" aria-labelledby="keyterm-feminist-theory" class="calibre11">A sociological perspective that emphasizes the centrality of gender in analyzing the social world and particularly the uniqueness of the experience of women. There are many strands of feminist theory, but they all share the desire to explain gender inequalities in society and to work to overcome them.</dd>
<dt id="keyterm-liberal-feminism" class="calibre10"><a role="doc-backlink" href="part0067_split_002.html#refover-liberal-feminism">liberal feminism</a></dt>
<dd role="definition" id="liberal-feminism" aria-labelledby="keyterm-liberal-feminism" class="calibre11">The form of feminist theory that posits that gender inequality is produced by unequal access to civil rights and certain social resources, such as education and employment, based on sex. Liberal feminists tend to seek solutions through changes in legislation that ensure that the rights of individuals are protected.</dd>
<dt id="keyterm-radical-feminism" class="calibre10"><a role="doc-backlink" href="part0067_split_002.html#refover-radical-feminism">radical feminism</a></dt>
<dd role="definition" id="radical-feminism" aria-labelledby="keyterm-radical-feminism" class="calibre11">The form of feminist theory that posits that gender inequality is the result of male domination in all aspects of social and economic life.</dd>
<dt id="keyterm-patriarchy" class="calibre10"><a role="doc-backlink" href="part0067_split_002.html#refover-patriarchy">patriarchy</a></dt>
<dd role="definition" id="patriarchy" aria-labelledby="keyterm-patriarchy" class="calibre11">The dominance of men over women. All known societies are patriarchal, although there are variations in the degree and nature of the power that men exercise as compared with women. One of the prime objectives of women’s movements in modern societies is to combat existing patriarchal institutions.</dd>
<dt id="keyterm-black-feminism" class="calibre10"><a role="doc-backlink" href="part0067_split_002.html#refover-black-feminism">Black feminism</a></dt>
<dd role="definition" id="black-feminism" aria-labelledby="keyterm-black-feminism" class="calibre11">A strand of feminist theory that highlights the multiple disadvantages of gender, class, and race that shape the experiences of non-White women. Black feminists reject the idea of a single, unified gender oppression that is experienced evenly by all women, and argue that early feminist analysis reflected the specific concerns of White, middle-class women.</dd>
<dt id="keyterm-transnational-feminism" class="calibre10"><a role="doc-backlink" href="part0067_split_002.html#refover-transnational-feminism">transnational feminism</a></dt>
<dd role="definition" id="transnational-feminism" aria-labelledby="keyterm-transnational-feminism" class="calibre11">A branch of feminist theory that highlights the way that global processes—including colonialism, racism, and imperialism—shape gender relations and hierarchies.</dd>
<dt id="keyterm-postmodern-feminism" class="calibre10"><a role="doc-backlink" href="part0067_split_002.html#refover-postmodern-feminism">postmodern feminism</a></dt>
<dd role="definition" id="postmodern-feminism" aria-labelledby="keyterm-postmodern-feminism" class="calibre11">The feminist perspective that challenges the idea of a unitary basis of identity and experience shared by all women. Postmodern feminists reject the claim that a grand theory can explain the position of women in society, or that there is any single, universal essence or category of “woman.” Instead, postmodern feminism encourages the acceptance of many different standpoints as equally valid.</dd>
