<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Understanding Sex Differences: The Role of Biology</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">How much are differences in the behavior of women and men the result of sex—that is, biological differences—rather than gender? Some researchers assert that innate behavioral differences between the sexes appear in some form in all cultures; studies of sociobiology (Goldberg, 1999) and evolutionary behavior strongly support this idea (Eagly and Wood, 2011). For example, the fact that in almost all cultures, men rather than women take part in hunting and warfare suggests that men possess biologically based tendencies toward aggression that women lack. Scholars who endorse this perspective might also look at current occupational patterns and attribute them to biology. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in 2019, 96 percent of dental hygienists, 93 percent of all secretaries, and 90 percent of registered nurses in the United States were women, whereas 98 percent of auto mechanics and 95 percent of welders were male (BLS, 2019j). Supporters of the “nature” perspective might point out that women are “wired” to choose jobs that are supportive and nurturing, whereas men opt for jobs that require more physical strength or mechanical ability.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most social scientists are unconvinced by these arguments, and even view them as potentially dangerous. In her classic book <i class="italic">The Lenses of Gender</i>, Sandra Lipsitz Bem (1993) notes that this kind of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-biological-essentialism" href="part0066_split_005.html#biological-essentialism">biological essentialism</a> rationalizes and legitimizes gender differences as the natural and inevitable consequences of the intrinsic biological natures of women and men. As such, social influences are neglected or minimized. For example, social scientists who denounce biological essentialism would argue that the level of aggressiveness in men varies widely across cultures, and women are expected to be more passive or gentle in some cultures than in others (Elshtain, 1981).</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_330" title="330"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Further, some argue that women are just as aggressive as men; however, women use strategies that are consistent with gender role socialization. One meta-analysis of aggression in “real-world” (rather than laboratory) settings found that men generally show higher levels of aggression than women at all ages, yet among children and teens, women were more likely to use “indirect aggression” (Archer, 2004). For instance, adolescent girls will use “interpersonal aggression,” such as malicious gossip or “bad-mouthing,” rather than physical fights (Bjorkqvist, Lagerspetz, and Osterman, 2006). Other data suggest that as gender roles change over time, girls may become more physically aggressive. A national study conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, 2010) found that 19 percent of adolescent females got into a serious fight at school or work in the past year, 14 percent participated in a group-against-group fight, and nearly 6 percent attacked another person with the intent to cause serious harm.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Theories of “natural difference” are often grounded in data on animal behavior, critics say, rather than in anthropological or historical evidence about human behavior, which reveals variation over time and place. Despite critiques of the “nature” perspective, the hypothesis that biological factors determine behavior patterns cannot be wholly dismissed. Studies document persuasively that biological factors—including genetics, hormones, and brain physiology—differ by gender, and that these biological differences are associated with some social behaviors, including language skills, interpersonal interactions, and physical strength. However, nearly all social scientists agree that theories based solely on an innate predisposition neglect the vital role of social interaction in shaping human behavior.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What does the evidence show? One group of studies investigates gender differences in hormonal makeup. Some have claimed that the male sex hormone, testosterone, is associated with a propensity for violence (Archer, 1991). Research has indicated, for instance, that male monkeys castrated at birth become less aggressive than noncastrated monkeys; conversely, female monkeys given testosterone become more aggressive than normal females. However, it has also been found that providing monkeys with opportunities to dominate others actually increases testosterone levels. It is not the case that the hormone causes increased aggression; instead, aggressive behavior may affect production of the hormone (Steklis et al., 1985). In other words, there might be slight biological differences between men and women, but these small differences may be exacerbated and amplified by social contexts that promote behaviors that are consistent with gendered stereotypes and expectations.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another source of evidence is direct observation of animal behavior. Researchers who connect male aggression with biological influences often emphasize male aggressiveness among the higher animals. Among chimpanzees, they say, males are consistently more aggressive than females. Yet critics note that there are large differences among types of animals. Gibbons, for instance, show few sex differences in aggression. Moreover, many female apes or monkeys are highly aggressive in some situations, such as when their young are threatened.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Other evidence comes from studies of identical twins, who derive from a single egg and have exactly the same genetic makeup. In one anomalous but particularly high-profile case, one identical male twin was seriously injured while being circumcised, and the decision was made by his physician and parents to reconstruct his genitals as female. He was thereafter raised as a girl. At age six, the twins demonstrated typical <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_331" title="331"></span>male and female traits as found in Western culture. The little girl enjoyed playing with other girls, helped with the housework, and wanted to get married when she grew up. The boy preferred the company of other boys, his favorite toys were cars and trucks, and he wanted to become a firefighter or police officer (Colapinto, 2001).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For some time, this case was treated as conclusive evidence of the overriding influence of social learning on gender differences. However, when the girl was a teenager, she was interviewed during a television program and revealed some unease about her gender identity, even wondering if perhaps she was “really” a boy after all. She had by then learned of her unusual background, and this knowledge may have led to an altered perception of herself (Colapinto, 2001).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Technological advances in the last two decades have provided a new source of evidence: brain-imaging research, which has identified several key differences between men’s and women’s brains (Brizendine, 2007, 2010). For example, Burman and colleagues (2007) found that the brains of school-age girls were more highly “activated,” or worked harder, than the brains of school-age boys when presented with spelling and writing tasks. This greater level of activation has been associated with greater accuracy in performing such tasks. The authors do not conclude that girls’ language skills are superior to those of boys, yet they do argue that their data show that girls and boys learn language in different ways. A mounting body of research concludes that gender differences in brain functioning may contribute, in part, to a wide range of social outcomes, including communication style, empathy, depression, anxiety, and fear. However, most scholars conducting this research are careful to point out that biological differences are almost always exacerbated or fostered by social contexts and norms (McCarthy, 2015).</p>
