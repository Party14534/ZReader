<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">All research involving human beings can pose ethical dilemmas. A key question for sociologists is whether research poses risks to subjects that are greater than the risks those subjects face in their everyday lives. For example, ethnographers and field researchers conducting research in areas with high crime rates potentially risk getting their subjects arrested with their writings or getting themselves arrested simply for observing and participating in the lives of the people whom they are trying to understand. Although a great deal of sensitivity to such issues exists in contemporary social science, one largely unanswered question relates to exploitation: Are social scientists benefitting at their subjects’ expense? Most studies don’t address such questions, and some social scientists are never forced to think seriously about them. The question of exploitation arises more in qualitative field studies than in quantitative research, but it must be considered whenever people’s careers come to depend on the advancement of sociological knowledge. For example, if a scholar earns money on a book based on cooperation with research subjects, should that money be shared with the subjects?</p>
