<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">If you have ever watched a film like <i class="italic">The Godfather</i> or <i class="italic">Goodfellas</i>, you probably think of mobsters as quite exotic. Like drug dealers or vagrants, members of the Mafia appear to us as social deviants, individuals who don’t conform to normal standards. Yet, while some members of the Mafia are violent criminals who could never achieve a typical existence, most mobsters ultimately end up exiting the world of crime and living respectably over the course of their lives.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This essential fact was discovered by Francis Ianni in a classic study that made many people question their basic assumptions about the mob. Ianni had grown up in a Mafia family, and he wrote his dissertation about the relatives whom he had known since childhood. Central to Ianni’s work is the claim that Mafia members commit crimes to engage in a “quiet and determined push toward respectability” (Gladwell, 2014). Like other American immigrants, the Mafia members he studied sought to realize the American dream but found themselves barred from many of the resources and institutions available to other citizens. Crime became the primary vehicle through which Mafia families moved into the mainstream of American society. But once they had the money to start their own legitimate businesses, they did move on.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While members of the Lupollo clan may have started as “rule breakers” working as bootleggers in the Prohibition era, Ianni notes that of the 42 members of the Lupollo clan, only 4 were engaged in criminal activities four decades later in 1972, with the majority of profits from illegal activities re-invested into legal enterprises. Over time, the family increasingly separated their illegal businesses from their legal businesses. By the end of the twentieth century, families like the Lupollo clan had become fully integrated members of mainstream society, moving from rule breakers to conformists. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_199" title="199"></span>Further, even when engaged in illegal activities, Mafia members maintained a clearly organized leadership structure and followed strict codes of family loyalty, mutual aid, and secrecy. In this way, the Mafia also acted as rule creators.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We have learned in previous chapters that social life is governed by norms that define some kinds of behavior as appropriate in particular contexts and others as inappropriate. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-norms" href="part0046_split_002.html#norms">Norms</a> are principles or rules that people are expected to observe; they represent the “dos and don’ts” of society. Ianni found that while members of the Mafia may break some of the rules that many of us follow in mainstream society, they also follow their own set of norms to regulate behavior. Ianni describes the business of the Lupollo clan as governed by a strict set of rules about family loyalty and mutual aid. As such, members of the Mafia may have different definitions of who is “deviant” and who is “conformist.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Actually, we are all rule breakers as well as conformists. We are all also rule creators. For example, most American drivers may break the law on the freeways, but in fact, they’ve developed informal rules superimposed on the legal rules. When the legal speed limit is 65 mph, most drivers don’t go above 75 mph or so, and they drive more slowly through urban areas. As a result, when we study deviant behavior, we must consider which rules people are observing and which ones they are breaking. Nobody breaks all rules, just as no one conforms to all rules. The behaviors that are defined as deviant may even change over time.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The study of deviant behavior reveals that none of us is as normal as we think. It also shows that people whose behavior appears incomprehensible or alien can be seen as rational beings when we understand why they act as they do. Indeed, if we can understand members of the Mafia as citizens working in pursuit of respectability, we might also consider how contemporary gang members, drug dealers, or homeless people might also be following a stable set of norms that may differ from our own—and that they may even aspire to live by a set of norms similar to our own.</p>
