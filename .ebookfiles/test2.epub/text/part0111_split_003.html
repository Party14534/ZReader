<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">New Religious Movements</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, sociologists are aware that the terms <i class="italic">sect</i> and <i class="italic">cult</i> have negative connotations, so instead, they sometimes use the phrase <i class="italic">new religious movements</i> to characterize novel religious organizations lacking the respectability that comes with being well established for a long period (Hadden, 1997b; Hexham and Poewe, 1997). <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-new-religious-movements" href="part0111_split_007.html#new-religious-movements">New religious movements</a> encompass an enormously diverse range of religious and spiritual groups, cults, and sects that have emerged in Western countries, including the United States, alongside mainstream religions. One example is the Unification Church, founded by the Korean Sun Myung Moon. The cult boasts a membership of 50,000 in the United States and 3 million worldwide (Melton, 1996). Other new religious movements include Scientology, Wicca, Eckankar, Druidism, Lukumi (also called Santería), and Rastafarianism. Their beliefs might seem unusual mixtures of traditional and modern religious ideas, but in fact, all long-established religions mix elements from diverse cultural sources.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This change in characterization has proven to be controversial, however. A loosely knit “anti-cult movement” composed of academics, church groups, families of cult members, and some former cult members themselves argues that regarding cults simply as “new religious movements” masks their identity as fringe organizations that can be dangerous and even deadly. Janja Lalich, a sociologist who at one time belonged to a political organization she now views as a cult, argues that cults can be distinguished from new religious movements by the virtually total control they exert over members’ daily lives and thinking. Cult members, she argues, exist in a situation of “bounded choice”: However seemingly irrational, harmful, or even fatal their acts (as in the examples of Heaven’s Gate and Aum Shinrikyo), they are done “in a context that makes perfect sense at the time to those who [perform the acts] and are, in fact, consistent with an ideology or belief system that [the members] trust represents their highest aspirations” (Lalich, 2004). Cult members are socialized into a way of thinking that is all-encompassing; they are not permitted to question the authority of the cult leader and so come to view the cult’s beliefs, however bizarre or dangerous, as normal.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">From the new religious movement perspective, cults—like all <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-religious-movements" href="part0111_split_007.html#religious-movements">religious movements</a>—can be best understood sociologically as a subtype of social movements. A religious movement is an association of people who spread a new religion or promote a new interpretation of an existing religion. From this perspective, all sects and cults can be classified as religious <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_679" title="679"></span>movements. Examples of religious movements include the groups that originally founded and spread Christianity in the first century, the Lutheran movement that split Christianity in Europe about 1,500 years afterward, and the groups involved in the more recent Islamic Revolution (discussed later in the chapter).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Religious movements pass through phases of development. In the first phase, the movement derives life and cohesion from a powerful leader. Max Weber classified such leaders as <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-charismatic" href="part0111_split_007.html#charismatic">charismatic</a>—that is, having inspirational qualities capable of capturing the imagination and devotion of a mass of followers. (Charismatic leaders in Weber’s formulation could include political as well as religious figures—revolutionary China’s Mao Zedong, for example, as well as Jesus and Muhammad.) The leaders of religious movements usually criticize the religious establishment and proclaim a new message. In their early years, religious movements are fluid; they do not have an established authority system. Their members are normally in direct contact with the charismatic leader, and together they spread the new teachings.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The second phase occurs following the death of the charismatic leader, when the movement must face what Weber termed the “routinization of charisma.” To survive, the movement has to create formalized rules and procedures because it can no longer depend on the central role of the original leader in organizing the followers. Many movements fade away when their leaders die or lose influence. A movement that takes on a permanent character becomes a church—a formal organization of believers with an established power structure and established symbols and rituals. The church itself might later become the source of other movements that question its teachings and either set themselves up in opposition to the church or break away.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many new religious movements are derived from mainstream religious traditions, such as Hinduism, Christianity, and Buddhism, whereas others have emerged from traditions that were almost unknown in the West until recently. Some new religious movements are creations of the charismatic leaders who head their activities. This is the case with the previously mentioned <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_680" title="680"></span>Unification Church, led by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon until his death in 2012, when his widow, Hak Ja Han, became the church’s spiritual leader. Members are expected to fraternize only with one another, to donate their property to the church, and to obey the church’s commands. This new religious movement was introduced into the United States at the beginning of the 1960s, and it appealed to many who were rejecting traditional religion and looking for insight in Eastern religious teachings. Membership in new religious movements mostly consists of converts rather than individuals brought up in a particular faith. Members are usually well educated and from middle-class backgrounds.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Various theories explain the popularity of new religious movements. Some observers argue that they reflect liberalization and secularization within society and within traditional churches. People who feel that traditional religions have become ritualistic and devoid of spiritual meaning may find comfort and a greater sense of community in smaller, less impersonal new religious movements. Others see new religious movements as an outcome of rapid social change (Wilson, 1982). As traditional social norms are disrupted, people search for explanations and reassurance. The rise of groups and sects emphasizing personal spirituality, for example, suggests that many individuals need to reconnect with their own values or beliefs in the face of instability and uncertainty.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Furthermore, new religious movements may appeal to people who feel alienated from mainstream society. The collective, communal approaches of sects and cults, some authors argue, can offer support and a sense of belonging. For example, today’s middle-class youth are not marginalized from society in a material sense, but they may feel isolated emotionally and spiritually. Membership in a cult can overcome this alienation (Wallis, 1984).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">New religious movements fall into three broad categories: <i class="italic">world-affirming</i>, <i class="italic">world-rejecting</i>, and <i class="italic">world-accommodating</i> movements. Each category is based on the relationship of the group to the larger social world. The enduring popularity of new religious movements presents another challenge to the secularization thesis. Opponents point to the diversity and dynamism of new religious movements and argue that religion and spirituality remain central facets of modern life. As traditional religions lose their hold, they claim, religion is not disappearing but is heading in new directions. Not all scholars agree, however. Proponents of secularization hold that these movements remain peripheral to society, even if they profoundly affect the lives of their followers. New religious movements are fragmented and relatively unorganized; they also suffer from high turnover rates. Compared to a serious religious commitment, proponents argue, participation in a new religious movement appears to be little more than a hobby or lifestyle choice.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">World-affirming Movements</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-world-affirming-movements" href="part0111_split_007.html#world-affirming-movements">World-affirming movements</a> are more like self-help or therapy groups than conventional religious groups. These movements often lack rituals, churches, or formal theologies, focusing instead on members’ spiritual well-being. World-affirming movements do not reject the outside world or its <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_681" title="681"></span>values. Rather, they seek to enhance their followers’ abilities to perform and succeed in that world by unlocking human potential.</p>
<figure class="figure--fullwidth" data-figure-id="ch17ph11"><a data-href="../images/Ch17ph11.jpg" tabindex="0" data-size="4086x2514"><img class="figure__image" alt="" src="../images/00261.jpeg" data-image-id="ch17ph11"/></a>
<figcaption class="figure__caption">World-affirming movements such as the Church of Scientology, which was established by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard in 1954, are inclusive and focus on members’ spiritual well-being.</figcaption>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Church of Scientology is one such group. Founded by L. Ron Hubbard, it has grown from its original base in California to include a large membership worldwide. Scientologists believe that all people are spiritual beings but have neglected their spiritual nature. Through training that makes them aware of their real spiritual capacities, people can recover forgotten supernatural powers, clear their minds, and reveal their full potential.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many strands of the so-called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-new-age-movement" href="part0111_split_007.html#new-age-movement">New Age movement</a> are world-affirming movements. The New Age movement emerged from the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s and encompasses a broad spectrum of beliefs, practices, and ways of life. Pagan teachings (Celtic, Druidic, Native American, and others), shamanism, forms of Asian mysticism, Wiccan rituals, and Zen meditation are among activities thought of as New Age.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The mysticism of the New Age movement appears to contrast with the modern societies in which it is favored. Followers of New Age movements develop alternative ways of life to cope with the challenges of modernity. Yet New Age activities should not be interpreted as simply a radical break with the present. They are also part of a larger <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_682" title="682"></span>cultural trajectory exemplifying mainstream culture. In modern societies, individuals possess unparalleled degrees of autonomy and freedom to chart their own lives. The aims of the New Age movement thus coincide closely with those of the modern age: People are encouraged to move beyond traditional values and expectations and to live actively and reflectively.</p>

<section id="world-rejecting-movements-section">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">World-rejecting Movements</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-world-rejecting-movements" href="part0111_split_007.html#world-rejecting-movements">World-rejecting movements</a> are highly critical of the outside world and often demand significant lifestyle changes from their followers—such as living ascetically, changing their dress or hairstyle, or following a certain diet. World-rejecting movements are frequently exclusive, in contrast to world-affirming movements, which are inclusive. Some world-rejecting movements display characteristics of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-total-institutions" href="part0111_split_007.html#total-institutions">total institutions</a>; members subsume their individual identities into that of the group, follow strict ethical codes or rules, and withdraw from activity in the outside world.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most world-rejecting movements demand more of their members, in terms of time and commitment, than do older established religions. Some groups use the technique of “love bombing” to gain the individual’s total adherence. A potential convert is overwhelmed by attention and constant displays of affection until he or she is drawn emotionally into the group. The Unification Church reportedly employs this technique. Some new movements, in fact, have been accused of brainwashing their adherents—robbing them of the capacity for independent decision making (Lalich, 2004).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many world-rejecting cults and sects have come under the intense scrutiny of state authorities, the media, and the public. Certain extreme cases have attracted much concern. The Branch Davidian cult, based in Waco, Texas, became embroiled in a deadly confrontation with federal authorities in 1993 after accusations of child abuse and weapons stockpiling. Eighty members of the cult (including 19 children) burned to death in their compound during an assault by federal officials that ended a lengthy armed standoff. Federal officials maintain that the cult members were virtual prisoners of their charismatic leader, David Koresh, who was allegedly stockpiling illegal weapons, had numerous wives, and was having sex with some of the children. Controversy remains over whether the fire was ordered by Koresh, who reportedly preferred mass suicide to surrender, or whether the actions of the federal authorities caused the tragedy (Tabor and Gallagher, 1995).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">World-accommodating Movements</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-world-accommodating-movements" href="part0111_split_007.html#world-accommodating-movements">World-accommodating movements</a> emphasize the importance of inner religious life over more worldly concerns. Members of such groups seek to reclaim the spiritual purity that they believe has been lost in traditional religious settings. Whereas followers of world-rejecting and world-affirming groups may alter their lifestyles in accordance with their religious activity, many adherents of world-accommodating movements carry on their lives and careers with little visible change. One example <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_683" title="683"></span>is Pentecostalism, a Christian renewal movement that emphasizes the direct, ecstatic experience of God that its adherents believe existed at the time of Christ. Pentecostals believe that the Holy Spirit can be heard through individuals who are granted the gift of “speaking in tongues.”</p>
