<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">G. H. Mead and the Development of Self</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because Mead’s ideas underlie a general tradition of theoretical thinking, symbolic interactionism, they have had a broad impact in sociology. Symbolic interactionism emphasizes that interaction between human beings occurs through symbols and the interpretation of meanings (see <a href="part0009_split_000.html#8IL20-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 1</a>). But Mead’s work also describes the main phases of child development, concentrating on the emergence of a sense of self.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to Mead, infants and young children develop as social beings by imitating the actions of those around them. Play is one way in which this development occurs. A small child will make mud pies, having seen an adult cooking, or will dig with a spoon, having observed someone gardening. Children’s play evolves from simple imitation to more complicated games in which a child of four or five years old will act out an adult role. Mead called this “taking the role of the other”—learning what it is like to be in the shoes of another person. At this stage, children acquire a developed sense of self. Children achieve an understanding of themselves as separate agents—as a “me”—by seeing themselves through the eyes of others. We achieve self-awareness, according to Mead, when we learn to distinguish the “me” from the “I.” The “I” is the unsocialized infant, a bundle of spontaneous wants and desires. The “me” is the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-self" href="part0030_split_007.html#social-self">social self</a>. Individuals develop <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-self-consciousness" href="part0030_split_007.html#self-consciousness">self-consciousness</a>, Mead argued, by coming to see themselves as others see them.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A further stage of child development occurs when the child is eight or nine years old, the age at which children take part in organized games rather than unsystematic play. During this period, children begin to understand the values and morality that govern social life. To learn organized games, children must understand the rules of play and notions of fairness and equal participation. Children at this stage learn to grasp what Mead termed the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-generalized-other" href="part0030_split_007.html#generalized-other">generalized other</a>—the general values and moral rules of the culture in which they are developing.</p>
