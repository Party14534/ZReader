<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">Rational Choice Theory</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Max Weber thought that all behavior could be divided into four categories: (1) behavior oriented toward higher values, such as politics; (2) behavior oriented toward habit, such as walking to school on a familiar path; (3) behavior oriented toward affect (emotions), such as falling in love; and (4) behavior oriented toward self-interest, such as making money. Behavior in the last category is often called “instrumental,” or “rational,” action. In recent years, many sociologists have adopted an approach that focuses on this type of behavior. This approach has led numerous scholars to ask under what conditions human behavior can be said to constitute rational responses to opportunities and constraints.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-rational-choice-approach" href="part0012_split_007.html#rational-choice-approach">rational choice approach</a> posits that if you could have only a single variable to explain society, self-interest would be the best one. A person who believes in this approach might even use it to explain things that seem irrational. One popular rational choice theory sees decisions to marry as maximizing self-interest in a marriage market; this understanding might explain why marriage has declined the most in poor African American communities with low rates of employment. The explanation—that it is not in the self-interest of women to marry men who cannot support them (Wilson, 1987)—goes against competing explanations suggesting that poor African Americans don’t marry because they don’t share mainstream values. The rational choice argument sees the decline as having little to do with values and much to do with self-interest under existing conditions. According to this theory, if employment rates for Black men were to change, so would the number of “eligible” men and the desire of women to marry them.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Rational choice theorists find few irrational mysteries in life. One of the few some note is love, which they define as the irrational act of substituting another person’s self-interest for one’s own (Becker, 1991). But such a definition makes it difficult to distinguish among basic altruism, friendship, and romantic love. Indeed, although a rational choice approach often can be useful, it cannot explain some aspects of life. Consider an angry driver who tries to teach a tailgater a lesson by tailgating the tailgater. Self-interest does not explain this action, because the “teacher” is unlikely personally to reap the benefits of a lesson well learned (Katz, 1999).</p>
