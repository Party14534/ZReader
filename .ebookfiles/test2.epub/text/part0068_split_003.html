<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Early in this chapter, we saw how the career of Kelley Voelker was derailed after she returned from maternity leave. One key reason women face compromised labor force prospects relative to men is that household duties, ranging from child care to elder care to daily housework, are disproportionately borne by women. Over the past three decades, sociologists have documented that work and family are competing social roles, and women’s family lives often impede their career and professional prospects.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although there have been revolutionary changes in women’s status in the United States in recent decades, including the entry of women into male-dominated professions, one area of work has lagged far behind: housework. Because of the increase of married women in the workforce and the resulting change in status, it was presumed that men would contribute more to housework. On the whole, this has not been the case. Although men now do more housework than they did three decades ago, a large gender gap persists. In 1965, women performed 32 hours of housework per week; this figure had dropped to 18 hours by 2011, and down to an average of 15 hours by 2018. By contrast, men’s housework increased from 4 to 10 hours per week between 1965 and 2011, and have remained unchanged as of 2018. However, these statistics indicate that women still put in significantly more time than their spouses (Parker and Wang, 2013; BLS, 2019d).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) provides further insights into the ways men and women spend their time each day. On the typical day, 21 percent of men reported doing any housework—such as cleaning or doing laundry—compared with 50 percent of women. Forty-six percent of men did food preparation or cleanup activities, compared to 69 percent of women. Men were slightly more likely to engage in lawn and garden care than were women—11 percent compared with 7 percent. On those days when they performed any of these activities, women spent an average of 2.6 hours per day while men spent 2 hours (BLS, 2019c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Further investigation shows that it is the intersection of gender, marital status, and parental status that most powerfully shapes housework. A recent study demonstrated that whereas women save their husbands an hour of housework a week, husbands create an additional 8 hours of housework for wives every week. Childless women do an average of 10 hours of housework a week before marriage and 17 hours after marriage. Childless men, by contrast, do 8 hours before marriage and 7 hours afterward. Married women with more than three kids are the most overworked, reporting an average of about 28 hours, while married men with more than three kids logged only 10 hours of housework a week (University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, 2008).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One reason that wives—even full-time employed, high-earning women—perform more hours of housework than their husbands is that women and men specialize in different chores. The chores that women typically perform are more time-consuming and happen on a daily rather than a sporadic basis. Wives do most of the daily chores, such as cooking and routine cleaning, while husbands take on more occasional tasks, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_359" title="359"></span>such as mowing the lawn and doing home repairs. The major difference is the amount of control the individual has over when the work gets done. Women’s household jobs bind them to a fixed schedule, whereas men’s are more discretionary.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Women also spend more time on child-rearing responsibilities, which reflects pervasive assumptions that women are “naturally” the primary caregiver (Shelton, 1992). Sociologists argue that underlying this inequitable distribution of tasks is the implicit understanding that men and women are responsible for different spheres. Men are expected to be providers, women to be caretakers—even if they are breadwinners as well as mothers. By reproducing in everyday life these roles learned during childhood socialization, men and women “do gender” and reinforce it as a means for society to differentiate between the sexes.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some sociologists have further suggested that women’s greater burden at home is best explained as a result of economic forces: Household work is exchanged for economic support. Because women earn less than men, they are more likely to remain economically dependent on their husbands and thus perform the bulk of the housework. Until the earnings gap is narrowed, women will likely remain in their dependent position. Yet, ironically, the gender gap in housework and child care contributes to women’s inferior economic position. Part of the reason that family responsibilities create obstacles for women is that their employers and colleagues may hold stereotypical ideas about women workers—especially the belief that mothers are less committed to their careers and thus less appropriate candidates for promotion than non-mothers. Research by Stanford University sociologist Shelley Correll and colleagues (Correll, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_360" title="360"></span>Benard, and Paik, 2007) found that mothers are 44 percent less likely to be hired than non-mothers who have the same work experience and qualifications; and mothers are offered significantly lower starting pay than equally qualified non-mothers (an average of $11,000 lower in this study) for the same job.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Women’s struggles with the work-family balance illustrate the powerful ways that gender shapes our daily lives. As long as most of the population takes it for granted that parenting cannot be shared on an equal basis by both women and men, the problems facing women employees such as Kelley Voelker will persist. It will remain a fact of life, as one of the managers stated, that women are disadvantaged compared with men in their career opportunities. Yet the same forces that conspire to limit women’s employment opportunities also may limit men’s engagement with child rearing, carrying long-term implications for father-child relations. The expectation that men should be breadwinners prevents men from taking parental leave, even when the benefit is available to them. Sociologists have observed a “flexibility stigma,” where men face a stigma if they take parental leave, cut back on their hours, or take family-friendly work in order to balance child care with paid employment (Coltrane et al., 2013). The persistent gender-typed expectations whereby women privilege child care and men privilege paid work has set the stage for women’s economic disadvantage relative to men’s and fathers’ more tenuous ties with their children relative to mothers’ (Lamb and Lewis, 2013).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet public policies may be effective in counteracting the obstacles imposed by employers’ stereotypical views of mothers in the workplace. A team of sociologists led by Michelle Budig (2012) explored the ways that attitudes toward working mothers and public policies such as parental leave or public child care affected the earnings of women workers in 22 countries. They found that the “motherhood penalty” (or the earnings gap between mothers and childless women) varied across countries, ranging from just 4.5 percent to a whopping 33 percent. The gaps were smallest in nations where the cultural attitudes supported maternal employment and the government provided job-protected parental leave and publicly funded child care.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the coming decades, experts anticipate that we may see greater gender equity in housework and child care. A recent study of young adults ages 18 to 32 in the United States found that the majority of respondents—regardless of gender or education level—aspired to a romantic relationship in which they would share earnings and household/caregiving responsibilities equally with their partners (Pedulla and Thébaud, 2015). A report by the Pew Research Center reported that 56 percent of adults state that sharing chores is very important to a successful marriage (Geiger, 2016).</p>
