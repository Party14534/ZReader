<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This is a difficult question, and if you failed to answer it correctly, you are in good company. Very few Americans would get this question right. The correct order is Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, and Buddhism. Islam is the world’s second-largest religion, with an estimated 1.8 billion adherents—nearly a quarter of the global population; from 2015 to 2060, the Muslim population is projected to grow by a whopping 70 percent—more than twice as fast as the global population—due primarily to the religion’s young population and high fertility rate. In contrast, Christianity, currently the world’s largest religion with some 2.3 billion adherents, is projected to rise by 34 percent by 2060. This means that Muslims will likely outnumber Christians in the second half of this century (Lipka and Hackett, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While Hinduism and Judaism are both projected to increase in number of adherents, they are growing more slowly than the global population itself, so they will actually account for smaller percentages of the global population in 2060 than they did in 2015. The third-largest religious group in 2015, Hinduism has nearly 1.1 billion adherents and is projected to grow 27 percent by 2060. Judaism, with 14.3 million adherents, is projected to grow by only 15 percent by 2060. Lastly, Buddhism, which currently has nearly 500 million adherents, is projected to decline by 7 percent between 2015 and 2060 due to an aging population and low fertility rates (Pew Research Center, 2017c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are all most likely familiar to you—they are called the “Abrahamic faiths” because they all trace their origins to Abraham and all accept the Old Testament of the Bible as an authoritative religious source (although Christianity, unlike Judaism, is founded on the New Testament of the Bible as well, and Islam looks to the Qur’an as authoritative). Hinduism is less likely to be familiar, although yoga and meditation—practices associated with Hinduism and popularized in the United States—may provide at least superficial familiarity with the 4,000-year-old religion that originated in ancient India. The same can be <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_653" title="653"></span>said of Buddhism, a religion that also comes from India and includes contemplative practices such as meditation.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche announced, “God is dead.” Religions, he argued, used to be a point of reference for our sense of purpose and meaning. Henceforth, we would have to live without this security. Living in a world without God would mean creating our own values and getting used to what Nietzsche called “the loneliness of being”—understanding that our lives are without purpose and that no superior entities watch over our fate. Nietzsche believed that with the rise of science and technology, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-secularization" href="part0108_split_002.html#secularization">secularization</a>—the movement of a society away from religious beliefs and institutions—would triumph.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Nietzsche was clearly wrong in his prediction. Religion is one of the most truly global of all social institutions, affecting many aspects of life. Throughout the world today, there is a religious revival. While religious revival is not limited to any particular socioeconomic group, it has especially taken root among those who are the most dispossessed. While globalization has brought benefits to many, it has brought hardship to many as well. Grinding poverty, in combination with the erosion of long-standing cultural values and traditions, is fertile ground for religious revival—especially among young people, who comprise a large part of the population in countries in the global south. One major study of secularization and religious revival in nearly 200 societies around the world concluded that religious revival is likely to win out over secularization among people who lack what the authors term “existential security”—“the feeling that survival is secure enough that it can be taken for granted” (Norris and Inglehart, 2004).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Why is it important to have better knowledge of the world’s religions? One reason is that it provides a better understanding of the global social changes of recent decades, in which religion has played a central role. For instance, in Vietnam in the 1960s, Buddhist priests burned themselves alive to protest the policies of the South Vietnamese government, contributing to the emergence of an antiwar movement in the United States, where the self-immolations were viewed on television. Today, Buddhist monks living in exile in India have set themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule over Tibet, while Buddhist monks in Thailand are protesting deforestation and inadequate care for AIDS victims.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">During the latter part of the twentieth century, an activist form of Catholicism, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-liberation-theology" href="part0108_split_002.html#liberation-theology">liberation theology</a>, combined Catholic beliefs with a passion for social justice for the poor, particularly in Central and South America and in Africa. Catholic priests and nuns organized farming cooperatives, built health clinics and schools, and challenged government policies that impoverished the peasantry; many paid with their lives for their activism, which government and military leaders often regard as subversive. Islamic socialists in Pakistan and Buddhist socialists in Sri Lanka have played a similar role (Berryman, 1987; Juergensmeyer, 1993; <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_654" title="654"></span>Sigmund, 1990). In some Central and Eastern European countries once dominated by the former Soviet Union, long-suppressed religious organizations helped to overturn socialist regimes during the early 1990s. In Poland, for example, the Catholic Church was allied with the Solidarity movement, which toppled the socialist government in 1989. Churches and religious leaders played a key role in the abolition of slavery in the United States in the nineteenth century and the civil rights movement in the twentieth century.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Religion has also been central in reviving ancient ethnic and tribal hatreds. In Bosnia and elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia, for example, religious differences helped justify “ethnic cleansing,” with Christian Serbs and Croats engaging in the mass murder, rape, and deportation of Muslims from communities and farmlands where the Muslims had lived for centuries. When religious beliefs align with strong national feelings, violence can result. And as we shall see, religious violence is not limited to any particular religion. While all major religions profess love and compassion, all have also given rise to offshoots that justify the use of violence (Juergensmeyer, 2001, 2008). Another reason it is important to better understand the world’s religions is that ignorance can fuel suspicion, prejudice, and hatred.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">On August 5, 2012, Wade Michael Page, a 40-year-old guitarist associated with hate-rock bands, walked into a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, and opened fire on the worshippers. Before police respondents arrived and shot him, he had killed six people and wounded others. Page’s reasons for shooting innocent worshippers may never be fully known; he died at the scene. But it is known that he was a White supremacist who hated Muslims and had reportedly called for massive bombing of the Middle East after September 11, 2001 (Goffard and Hennessy-Fiske, 2012). It seems likely that Page went on his shooting rampage intending to kill Muslims, not realizing that Sikhism is unrelated to Islam. Sikhism, a relatively new religious tradition some 500 years old, is unlikely to be familiar to most Americans, even though an estimated quarter million Sikhs live in the United States. To Page’s bigoted eye, the turbaned Sikh men, with their long black beards, were likely indistinguishable from Muslims.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">If Page indeed had been venting his anger against people he believed to be Muslims, he was not alone in harboring negative stereotypes. A nationwide survey in 2014 found that Americans viewed Islam more negatively than any other major religion (Pew Research Center, 2014m). Just three years earlier, a similar survey had found that only 57 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of Muslims, compared with 89 percent for Christians and 82 percent for Jews. Among those polled, roughly half believed that some religions are <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_655" title="655"></span>more prone to violence than others; fully 70 percent of those with such beliefs also claimed that Islam is the most violent religion, compared with 9 percent for Christianity and 2 percent for Judaism. In fact, nearly half (45 percent) of all Americans polled stereotyped Islam as violent, with 7 out of 10 reporting being concerned about Muslim extremism in the United States (Pew Research Center, 2011a).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Religion plays a key role in the world today. Religious groups were a major force in the Arab Spring that began with the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, a poor Tunisian street vendor who set himself on fire to protest harassment by corrupt local officials who had made it impossible for him to eke out a living selling produce from a cart. Bouazizi’s sacrifice, seen around the world on YouTube and other social media, sparked revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa that overturned dictatorships in Egypt, Libya, and Yemen and sparked a civil war in Syria.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The popular 2011 uprising in Cairo’s Tahrir Square toppled then-president Hosni Mubarak, a military leader who had run the country for 30 years. Egypt held its first free elections the following year, and the Muslim Brotherhood’s candidate, Mohamed Morsi, was elected president with 52 percent of the popular vote. A large and influential religious organization throughout the Arab world, the Muslim Brotherhood had been kept mainly underground until then. Morsi came to be seen by many Egyptians, including the still-powerful military, as moving to consolidate power and shift Egypt in a strong Islamist direction. In 2013, he was arrested by the military, which launched a brutal crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood and its perceived supporters. Tens of thousands were arrested as terrorists, and hundreds were sentenced to death. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the general who led the military coup, was elected president in 2014.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Arab Spring proved to be equally fleeting elsewhere in the Middle East. Syria, Yemen, and Libya were ravaged by internal strife and civil wars that had, at least in part, a religious dimension. Conflicts spilled over into Jordan and Lebanon, as well as parts of North Africa. With the exception of Egypt, where it was repressed, there was a resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism throughout the region. The only country to remain democratic, among all the countries that had participated in the Arab Spring, was Tunisia—the country where it began. We will return to the role of religion in the Middle East later in this chapter.</p>
