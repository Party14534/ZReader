<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we learned in <a href="part0053_split_000.html#1IHDQ0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 8</a>, the distribution of income in the United States is highly unequal, and this gap is widening. In 2018, the top 5 percent of households in the United States received 23.1 percent of total income, the highest 20 percent obtained 52 percent, while the bottom 20 percent received only slightly more than 3.1 percent (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019e). Some researchers have argued that societies with a vastly unequal distribution of economic resources are unhealthy societies, and that disparities take a toll on all.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">British researcher Richard Wilkinson (1996) is one of the most vocal advocates of the argument that the healthiest societies are not necessarily the richest ones but those in which income is distributed most evenly and levels of social integration are highest. In surveying empirical data from countries worldwide, Wilkinson notes a clear relationship between mortality rates and patterns of income distribution. Inhabitants of countries such as Japan and Sweden, which are among the most egalitarian societies in the world, enjoy better levels of health than do citizens of countries with a more pronounced gap between rich and poor, such as the United States. In Wilkinson’s view, growing income inequality undermines social cohesion and makes it more difficult for people to manage risks and challenges. Wilkinson argues that social factors—the strength of social contacts, ties within communities, a sense of security—are the main determinants of the health of a society.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Wilkinson’s thesis—that income inequality harms health—has provoked energetic responses. Some claim that his work should become required reading for policy makers and politicians. They agree that the drive toward prosperity has failed many members of society and that it is time to consider more humane and socially responsible policies to support those who are disadvantaged (Kawachi and Kennedy, 1997). Others criticize his study on methodological grounds and argue that he has not demonstrated a clear causal relationship between income inequality and poor health (Judge, 1995). Illness, critics contend, could be caused by any number of other factors. They argue that the empirical evidence for Wilkinson’s claims remains suggestive at best.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Two recent studies may help to successfully resolve this debate. Zheng (2012) tracked income inequality in the United States from 1986 through 2004 and then examined whether these trends predicted increases in poor health and mortality several years into the future. This approach allowed him to address the main concern Wilkinson’s critics raised—that he had not effectively established causal ordering. Zheng found that for every .01 increase in the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-gini-coefficient" href="part0119_split_005.html#gini-coefficient">Gini coefficient</a>—a standard measure of a country’s economic disparity, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents maximum inequality—an average person’s cumulative risk of death increased by 112 percent over the next 12 years. Zheng (2009) also found that a dramatic increase in income inequality between 1972 and 2004 increased Americans’ perceptions that their health was suffering.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although scholars and policy makers may find Zheng’s research to be compelling evidence that income inequality undermines health, we still don’t fully understand the reasons for this. Some scholars have hypothesized that in countries with rising income inequality, the interests of the wealthy tend to diverge from those of the rest of society. The wealthiest people may push government for more services for themselves, rather than invest in public goods such as education or affordable medical services—services that can affect health for the majority of people (Zheng, 2009, 2012). Others argue that inequality may create a culture of upward comparison, where many people see the lifestyles of the rich and feel they can’t live up to expectations. Upward comparison can lead to negative views of oneself, frustration, and depression, which have been linked to sickness and mortality (Kawachi and Kennedy, 1997; Pickett and Wilkinson, 2011). Consistent with this notion, recent cross-national studies show that levels of depression are higher in countries with high levels of income inequality, and a feeling of “status anxiety” partially accounts for this linkage (Layte, 2011).</p>
