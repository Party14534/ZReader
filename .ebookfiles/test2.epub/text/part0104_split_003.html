<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A third perspective, described as “critical” or Marxist, places the emphasis on social reproduction. In the context of education, social reproduction refers to the ways in which schools help perpetuate social and economic inequalities across the generations. A number of sociologists have argued that the hidden curriculum is the mechanism through which social reproduction occurs. The <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-hidden-curriculum" href="part0104_split_005.html#hidden-curriculum">hidden curriculum</a> refers to the idea that students from different social class backgrounds are provided different types of education, in terms of both curricular materials and the kinds of interactions in which their teachers engage them. More specifically, the notion of the hidden curriculum suggests that the expansion of education was brought about by employers’ needs for certain personality characteristics in their workers—self-discipline, dependability, punctuality, obedience, and the like—which are all taught in schools.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In their classic study of social reproduction, Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis (1976) provide an example of how the hidden curriculum works. They argue that modern education is a response to the economic needs of industrial capitalism. Schools help provide the technical and social skills industrial enterprise requires, and they instill discipline and respect for authority in the labor force. Schools also socialize children to get along with one another. Being able to “play well with others” is, after all, an important characteristic of a good worker.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Authority relations in school, which are hierarchical and place strong emphasis on obedience, directly parallel those dominating the workplace. The rewards and punishments held out in school also replicate those found in the world of work. Schools help motivate some individuals toward “achievement” and “success” while discouraging others, who find their way into low-paying jobs. You might even have noticed this in your own high school, where students from wealthier backgrounds took college-prep courses, while their classmates from more disadvantaged backgrounds were tracked into vocational programs. As noted earlier, institutions of higher learning tend to favor applicants whom they believe are most likely to have successful careers after graduation.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A cruder way of putting this idea is that schools facilitate the ruling class’s need to exploit a docile or cooperative workforce. Here the emphasis is on the fact that much of what students learn in school has nothing directly to do with the formal content of lessons. Schools, by the nature of the discipline and regimentation they entail, tend to teach students an uncritical acceptance of the existing social order. These lessons are not consciously taught; they are implicit in school procedures and organization. Thus, the hidden curriculum teaches children from underprivileged backgrounds that their role in life is “to know their place and to sit still with it” (Illich, 1983). Children spend long hours in school, and they learn a great deal more in the school context than is contained in the lessons they are actually taught. Children get an early taste of what the world of work will be like, learning that they are expected to be punctual and to apply themselves diligently to the tasks that those in authority set for them. From this perspective, even if a student in a poor inner-city school learned very little in her classes, the basic training she received in arriving on time for class would end up serving her well as a worker at a fast-food restaurant. Such an analysis can be quite depressing, but it may be a realistic way of understanding the place of education in the lives of such people.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Adherents to this perspective don’t completely dismiss the content of the official curriculum. They accept that the development of mass education has had many beneficial consequences. Illiteracy rates are low compared with premodern times, and schooling provides access to learning experiences that are intrinsically self-fulfilling. Yet because education has expanded mainly as a response to economic needs, the school system falls far short of what enlightened reformers had hoped it would achieve. That is, according to this perspective, schooling has not become the “great equalizer”; rather, within the current economic and political system, schooling reproduces social-class stratification.</p>
