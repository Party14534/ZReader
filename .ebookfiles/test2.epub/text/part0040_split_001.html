<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Imagine all the people to whom one average individual is directly and indirectly bound. The spread of COVID-19 can actually help us visualize the gigantic networks to which we are all consciously and unconsciously bound. Difficult as it may be to believe, the correct answer here is, in fact, d) 59,000 (Snow, 2020)! To understand just how quickly the virus can travel, let us take a look at “patient zero,” the first person in the metropolitan New York area to be diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">On March 2, 2020, New Rochelle resident Lawrence Garbuz, an attorney and founding partner of a Manhattan law firm, tested positive for the new coronavirus. Most likely he caught the virus locally as he had not travelled to any of the countries already hit by the pandemic. Knowing the speed with which the illness could spread, health investigators immediately began retracing the attorney’s steps and alerting those with whom he had spent time in the days leading up to his diagnosis. By March 10, the single case had grown to a cluster of 90, and by March 12, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo had imposed a mile-radius coronavirus containment zone around the city of New Rochelle.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The situation in New Rochelle can best be understood through the lens of sociology, most notably through the concept of the social <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-networks" href="part0040_split_002.html#networks">network</a>, that is, all the direct and indirect connections that link one particular individual or group with other people or groups. Following the footsteps of the investigators in this case, we can trace the network of this individual by examining the trajectory of the contagion.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the week prior to his diagnosis with COVID-19, Garbuz, a member of a tight-knit Modern Orthodox Jewish community who commutes daily on the Metro-North railway to his office in Manhattan, had had personal contact with between 800 and 1,000 people at two events that he had attended on the same day: a joint bar and bat mitzvah at the Young Israel of New Rochelle synagogue, and the funeral service of Marek Appell, a 91-year-old Holocaust survivor. Not long afterwards, Garbuz fell ill and was taken by a neighbor to a local hospital, where he was initially diagnosed with pneumonia. Only four days later was he tested for the new coronavirus. In the time between <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_167" title="167"></span>his hospital admission and the test, Garbuz came into contact with dozens of physicians, nurses, medical technicians, orderlies, and other patients. Once health officials learned of the diagnosis, they reached out to administrators at SAR High School and Yeshiva University, where Garbuz’s 14-year-old daughter and 20-year-old son were students. Classes at both institutions were immediately cancelled and teachers and students who had come in contact with the Garbuz’s children were ordered to self-quarantine. Within two weeks, 46 students, faculty, and parents at the high school had tested positive, as had Garbuz’s wife and children, the neighbor who had driven him to the hospital, and dozens of other individuals who had spent time with him during that period. In addition, many of the people who had socialized with Garbuz at the bar/bat mitzvah or funeral service had gone on to attend other bar mitzvahs or social functions before realizing that COVID-19 had surreptitiously entered their midst. By mid-April, the total number of infected in Westchester County had exceeded 24,000, making it the tenth-hardest-hit county in the United States.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we can see from this scenario, Garbuz’s network encompassed people he knew both directly (his friends and family) and indirectly (his friends’ friends and families). Also included in his network were the organizations in which he participated directly (his temple and law firm) and indirectly (his children’s high school and university, the local medical facility). As he was an active member of a large religious community that spilled over into neighboring towns, the virus was able to quickly penetrate the county, spreading anxiety across the region.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Practically overnight, life in the local Jewish community was totally transformed: the activities that had always helped bound it together—synagogue services, Shabbat dinners, bar and bat mitzvahs, weddings, and funerals—were now proscribed by social-distancing ordinances issued by the government, while school and daily prayers shifted to video-conferencing platforms. In the words of one local rabbi, “Between the first Tuesday and the second Tuesday, it all changed.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The shock experienced by members of the community as they struggled to adjust to this new disconnected reality was captured by a comment posted on Facebook by Garbuz’s wife, Alina Lewis. Updating her friends on her husband’s condition, she exclaimed: “He is trying to comprehend a world where no one goes out, no social gatherings, no religious services, no Purim!!”</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_168" title="168"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In this chapter we will consider the importance of social networks to every aspect of our existence, from matters of life and death to getting a job. We will also study different kinds of groups, the ways in which their size affects our behavior, and the nature of leadership. In addition, we will explore how group norms promote conformity, often to disastrous ends. We will then proceed to examine the role played by organizations in American society, look at major theories of modern organizations as well as at the ways in which organizations are changing in the modern world due to the impact of technology and the prominence of the Internet in our group life. We will end by discussing the debate over the decline in social capital and social engagement in the United States today.</p>
