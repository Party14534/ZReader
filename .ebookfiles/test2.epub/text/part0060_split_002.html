<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Middle-income countries (including lower-middle and upper-middle income) are primarily found in East and Southeast Asia, and also include the oil-rich countries of the Middle East and North Africa, a few countries in the Americas (Mexico, some Central American and Caribbean countries such as Cuba, and most countries in South America), and the once-Communist republics that formerly made up the Soviet Union and its East European allies. Having begun to industrialize relatively late in the twentieth century, most are neither as developed nor as wealthy as the high-income countries. The countries of the former Soviet Union, however, are highly industrialized, although, in many cases, their living standards eroded during their transition to capitalism after the collapse of communism during the period 1979–1991. In 2018, middle-income countries were home to 75 percent of the world’s population (5.7 billion people) but accounted for only 36 percent of the output produced that year. Although many residents are substantially better off than their neighbors in low-income countries, most do not enjoy anything resembling the standard of living common in high-income countries (World Bank, 2019c).</p>
