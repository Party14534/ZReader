<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We have demonstrated the many forms that gender inequalities take in society, in the workplace, in the family, in politics, and throughout the globe. Yet many readers of this textbook may wonder why gender inequalities still persist, especially during an era when young women outnumber young men in college classrooms, women make up nearly half the workforce, and a woman was nominated for president by a major political party. How and why do we see so much progress in some domains, but so little in others?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are no easy answers to questions of why gender inequalities persist in the United States and throughout the world. In this section, we will delve into three particularly vexing questions about inequality, and we will provide competing insights into why the gender pay gap persists, why men continue to abide so closely to harmful components of masculine social roles and behaviors, and why women are disproportionately the target of sexual violence, whether on college campuses in the United States or in the war-torn deserts in parts of Africa.</p>
