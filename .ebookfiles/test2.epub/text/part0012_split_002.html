<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Functionalism</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Symbolic interactionism has been criticized for concentrating too much on things that are small in scope. Symbolic interactionists have struggled to deal with larger-scale structures and processes—the very things that a rival tradition of thought, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-functionalism" href="part0012_split_007.html#functionalism">functionalism</a>, emphasizes. Functionalist thinking in sociology was originally pioneered by Comte, who saw it as closely bound up with his overall view of the field.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">To study the function of a social activity is to analyze its contribution to the continuation of the society as a whole. The best way to understand this idea is by analogy to the human body, a comparison that Comte, Durkheim, and other functionalist authors made. To study an organ such as the heart, we need to show how it relates to other parts of the body. When we learn how the heart pumps blood, we understand its vital role in the continuation of the organism’s life. Similarly, analyzing the function of some aspect of society, such as religion, means examining its role in the continued existence and health of a society. Functionalism emphasizes the importance of moral consensus in maintaining order and stability in society. Moral consensus exists when most people share the same values. Functionalists regard order and balance as the normal state of society—this social equilibrium is grounded in a moral consensus among the members of society. According to Durkheim, for instance, religion reaffirms people’s adherence to core social values, thereby helping to maintain social cohesion.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Functionalism became prominent in sociology through the writings of Talcott Parsons (1902–1979) and Robert K. Merton (1910–2003), each of whom saw functionalist analysis as providing the key to the development of sociological theory and research. Merton’s version of functionalism has been particularly influential.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In his work, Merton distinguished between manifest and latent functions. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-manifest-functions" href="part0012_split_007.html#manifest-functions">Manifest functions</a> are those known to, and intended by, the participants in a social activity. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-latent-functions" href="part0012_split_007.html#latent-functions">Latent functions</a> are consequences of that activity of which participants are unaware. Merton used the example of a rain dance performed by the Hopi tribe of Arizona and New Mexico. The Hopi believe that the ceremony <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_21" title="21"></span>will bring the rain they need for their crops (manifest function). This is why they organize and participate in the dance. But using Durkheim’s theory of religion, Merton argued that the rain dance also promotes the cohesion of Hopi society (latent function). A major part of sociological explanation, according to Merton, consists in uncovering the latent functions of social activities and institutions.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Merton also distinguished between functions and dysfunctions. To look for the dysfunctional aspects of social behavior means to focus on features of social life that challenge the existing order. For example, it is incorrect to suppose that religion is always functional—that it contributes only to social cohesion. When two groups support different religions or different versions of the same religion, the result can be major social conflicts, causing widespread social disruption. Thus, wars have often been fought between religious communities—as in the struggles between Protestants and Catholics in European history.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For much of the twentieth century, functionalist thought was considered the leading theoretical tradition in sociology, particularly in the United States. In recent years, its popularity has declined as its limitations have become apparent. While this was not true of Merton, many functionalist thinkers—Talcott Parsons is an example—unduly stressed factors leading to social cohesion at the expense of those producing division and conflict. In addition, many critics claim that functional analysis attributes to societies certain qualities they do not have. Functionalists often wrote as though societies had “needs” and “purposes,” even though these concepts make sense only when applied to individual human beings.</p>
