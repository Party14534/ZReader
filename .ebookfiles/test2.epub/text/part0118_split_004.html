<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">Reproduction in the Twenty-First Century: Pushing the Limits of Technology</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another area of research among contemporary scholars is the ways that science and technology shape experiences of the body. The development of technologies—ranging from reproductive technologies to the development of medications that help our mental health, physical health, and even sexual performance—has created a context where we have much more control over our bodies today than in the past. Yet this “control” presents us with both exciting possibilities and new anxieties and problems. All this <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_747" title="747"></span>development is part of what sociologists call the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-socialization-of-nature" href="part0118_split_005.html#socialization-of-nature">socialization of nature</a>—a process in which phenomena that used to be “natural,” or given in nature, become social, in that they depend on our personal decisions.</p>
<section id="childbirth">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Childbirth</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Giving birth is often described as a “natural” and “beautiful” part of life. For hundreds of years, most women’s lives were dominated by childbirth and child-rearing. In premodern times, contraception was ineffective or unknown. Even as late as the eighteenth century in Europe and the United States, women commonly experienced as many as 20 pregnancies (often involving miscarriages and infant deaths). Today, owing to improved methods of contraception, women in industrialized countries no longer have so many pregnancies. Advances in contraceptive technology enable most women and men to control whether and when to have children.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Contraception is only one <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-procreative-technology" href="part0118_split_005.html#procreative-technology">procreative technology</a>. Prospective parents also are turning to technologies that increase their chances of conceiving a child. Fertility drugs, in vitro fertilization (IVF), artificial insemination, and hormone treatments are among the technologies that are assisting reproductively challenged couples in their desire to start a family (Franklin, 2013). The use of such technologies also is altering the nature of family life; the number of twins born in the United States increased by roughly 50 percent, and the number of triplet or higher-number births soared by 404 percent between 1980 and 1997 (Martin and Park, 1999). From 1980 to 2004, increases in the number of twin births averaged nearly 3 percent a year (peaking at more than 4 percent from 1995 to 1998). From 2005 to 2011, however, the pace of increase slowed to one-half percent annually (Martin et al., 2013). Between 2014 and 2018, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that the birth rate of twins has decreased on average 1 percent annually, or 4 percent during the time period (Martin and Osterman, 2019). This rise and plateauing in multiple births is partially explained by the growing popularity of fertility drugs such as clomiphene and procedures such as in vitro fertilization, which result in multiple births more frequently than unassisted fertilizations do.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Genetic Engineering: Designer Babies</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the past, new parents had to wait until the birth to learn the sex of their baby and whether it would be healthy. Today, prenatal tests such as the sonogram (an image of the fetus produced by ultrasonic waves) and amniocentesis (which samples amniotic fluid from around the fetus) can reveal structural or chromosomal abnormalities before birth.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Considerable scientific resources are being devoted to intervening in the genetic makeup of the fetus to influence its subsequent development. The likely social effect of such genetic engineering is provoking debates almost as intense as those over abortion. According to supporters, genetic engineering will bring many benefits—for example, identifying the genetic factors that make some people vulnerable to certain diseases. Genetic reprogramming would ensure that these illnesses are no longer passed from <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_748" title="748"></span>generation to generation. It would be possible to “design” our children’s bodies before birth in terms of skin color, hair and eye color, weight, and so forth.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This issue is a prime example of the opportunities and problems that the increasing socialization of nature creates. What choices will parents make if they can design their babies, and what limits should be placed on those choices? Genetic engineering is unlikely to be cheap. Will this mean that those who can afford to pay will program out from their children any traits they see as socially undesirable? What will happen to the children of more deprived groups, who will continue to be born unaltered? Some sociologists argue that differential access to genetic engineering might lead to the emergence of a “biological underclass.” Those who don’t have the physical advantages that genetic engineering can bring might be subject to prejudice and discrimination and might have difficulty finding employment and life or health insurance (Duster, 1990).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The medical community also continues to grapple with the ethical implications of designing a baby (Murray, 2014). The core question is, how much discretion should parents be granted in determining what sort of child they have? A consensus has yet to be reached, as most major medical societies, such as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) vary widely in their recommendations about when and where these techniques should be allowed (Murray, 2014). For example, the ASRM typically honors a client’s wishes on issues such as sex selection, while the ACOG calls for the prohibition of sex selection because it may perpetuate gender discrimination in society. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), by contrast, regulates only the safety and effectiveness of genetic-engineering techniques and leaves ethical issues unaddressed. Debates over designer babies may lead to a reformulation of how we as a society think about reproduction and parenthood (Murray, 2014).</p>
