<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Poverty</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Just over 9 percent of persons age 65 and older currently live in poverty, although some of the very poorest Americans are older adults, particularly among Blacks and Latino persons, women, and those living in rural areas (Li and Dalaker, 2019). Because most older people have retired from <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_433" title="433"></span>full-time work, their income is based primarily on <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-security" href="part0080_split_008.html#social-security">Social Security</a> and private retirement programs, for those fortunate enough to have a private pension. Social Security and <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-medicare" href="part0080_split_008.html#medicare">Medicare</a> have been especially important in lifting many retirement-age people out of poverty. Yet people who depend solely on these two programs for income and health care coverage are likely to live modestly at best.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Nearly 9 out of 10 older adults receive Social Security benefits. In 2015, Social Security provided 33 percent of the average older adult’s income, earnings provided 34 percent, pensions provided 20 percent, and asset income accounted for 9 percent (Administration for Community Living, 2018). Low-income households in particular are likely to rely heavily on Social Security. Among older adults in the lowest fifth of the income distribution, Social Security accounts for 81 percent of aggregate income and cash public assistance for another 10 percent. By contrast, for those whose income is in the highest income category, Social Security accounts for 15 percent, pensions for 22 percent, and asset income for 14 percent; earnings account for 45 percent (Social Security Administration, 2016c). Yet even the combination of Social Security and private pensions results in modest retirement incomes for most people; in 2017, the median income of households headed by a person age 65+ was about $45,000 (Gusman, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The economic conditions of older adults have improved steadily since the 1970s due to major expansions of the Social Security program. In 1959, 35 percent of all people 65 or older lived in poverty. That figure began to drop during President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty in the mid-1960s, when Medicare was enacted and Social Security benefits increased. By the early 1970s, poverty rates among those ages 65+ had dropped to below 15 percent, and today, the rate is less than 9 percent. Contrast this with the rate of poverty among children under 18 years, 16.2 percent of whom were poor in 2018 (Semega et al., 2019). However, the low overall poverty rate among older adults conceals two serious problems: the economic strains facing persons in late midlife—those ages 55 to 64—and tremendous race and gender gaps in late-life poverty rates.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Poverty Among Persons Ages 55–64</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Great Recession of 2008 took a very severe toll on persons on the brink of retirement, those ages 55 to 64. As of September 2020, it was clear that millions of Americans had lost their jobs due to the economic downturns and business shutdowns that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Many near-retirement age adults whose businesses were shuttered also struggled to find new work, facing the added obstacle of ageism. These “nearly old or late-midlife” persons are among the older members of the large baby boom cohort, the 75 million babies born between roughly 1945 and 1964. The unemployment rates for workers between the ages of 55 and 64 more than doubled during the recession, from 3.1 percent in 2007 to 7.1 percent in 2010 (and decreased back down to 3.2% in 2016). According to a recent U.S. government study, unemployed older workers have more difficulty finding new jobs and remain unemployed for a longer period than their younger counterparts (U.S. Government Accountability Office [GAO], 2011). Some face discrimination by potential employers, who believe that older workers may be less able to acquire new skills. Others may have early onset health problems that limit the kind of work they can do. Due to the cohort’s large size, unemployed persons in their late fifties and early sixties may face stiff competition from their peers who are also seeking work.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">To make matters worse, many older Americans saw their retirement savings and home values plummet due to volatility in the stock and housing markets. The average income for adults age 55 to 64 fell by 6 percent during the recessionary period of 2007 to 2010, and their median household net worth dropped nearly 14 percent between 2007 and 2009. Due in part to their long spells of unemployment and evaporating assets, many near-old adults were pushed into poverty during the Great Recession. Poverty rates for adults age 55 to 64 rose from 8.6 percent in 2007 to 10.1 percent in 2010. As older Americans lost their employer-provided health insurance or exhausted their savings, many were forced to delay their medical care or receive Social Security early, at the age of 62, with a resulting 25 percent reduction in benefits.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It’s not surprising, then, that these aging baby boomers are very pessimistic about their financial situation. According to a 2012 poll conducted by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), only 54 percent of adults ages 50 to 64 are satisfied with their financial situation. As such, fully two-thirds say that they will delay their retirement, while one-half say they may never retire (Kiger, 2012). These strains and anxieties may set the stage for a difficult transition to old age; only future research will tell whether the well-being of older adults declines for future cohorts (GAO, 2011).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Subgroup Differences in Late-Life Poverty Rates</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The low overall poverty rate also conceals stark race, gender, and marital status differences in poverty among persons age 65+. In 2017, the poverty rate for older women was 10.5 percent compared to 7.5 percent for older men. Older Blacks and Hispanics experience the highest poverty rates at 19.1 percent and 17 percent, respectively, compared to 7 percent of older Whites and 10.9 percent of older Asians (Figure 12.4). We see the highest poverty rates among older women living alone: 41 percent of Hispanic women who live alone and 29 percent of Black women who live alone are in poverty (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2016a).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Despite tremendous improvements in overall economic well-being among older adults during the past half century, the future looks uncertain—at least for some older persons. Some policy experts argue that the current government indicator of poverty (see <a href="part0053_split_000.html#1IHDQ0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 8</a>) does not adequately capture the economic realities of late life. The federal government has proposed a new calculation that takes into account rising health care costs. Under this new formula, the proportion of older adults living in poverty would jump to 18.6 percent (Carr, 2019). Although some older adults may find their retirement years to be “golden,” others may need to continue working far past age 65 just to maintain a minimum standard of living (Carr, 2019).</p>
