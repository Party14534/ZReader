<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Through socialization, individuals learn about <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-roles" href="part0029_split_005.html#social-roles">social roles</a>—socially defined expectations for a person in a given social position. The social role of doctor, for example, encompasses a set of behaviors that all doctors should assume, regardless of their personal opinions or outlooks. Because all doctors share this role, we can speak in general terms about the professional behavior of doctors, regardless of the specific individuals who occupy that position.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some sociologists, particularly those associated with the functionalist school, regard social roles as unchanging parts of a society’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_108" title="108"></span>culture; they are social facts. According to this view, individuals learn the expectations for social positions in their particular culture and perform these roles largely as they have been defined. Social roles do not involve negotiation or creativity. Rather, they prescribe, contain, and direct an individual’s behavior. Through socialization, individuals internalize social roles and learn how to carry them out.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This view, however, is mistaken. It suggests that individuals simply take on roles rather than creating or negotiating them. In fact, socialization is a process in which humans can exercise agency; we are not simply passive subjects waiting to be instructed or programmed. Individuals come to understand and assume social roles through an ongoing process of social interaction.</p>
