<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Interactionist Theories</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists studying crime and deviance in the interactionist tradition focus on deviance as a socially constructed phenomenon. Rejecting the idea that some types of conduct are inherently “deviant,” they ask how behaviors get defined as deviant and why only certain groups get labeled as deviant.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 1949, Edwin H. Sutherland advanced a notion that influenced much of the later interactionist work: He linked crime to what he called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-differential-association" href="part0048_split_006.html#differential-association">differential association</a>. Differential association theory argues that we learn deviant behavior in precisely the same way we learn about conventional behavior: from our contacts with primary groups such as peers, family members, and coworkers. The term <i class="italic">differential</i> refers to the ratio of deviant to conventional social contacts. We become deviant when exposed to a higher level of deviant persons and influences, compared with conventional influences. In a society that contains a variety of subcultures, some individuals have greater exposure to social environments that encourage illegal activities.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Labeling Theory</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the most important interactionist approaches to understanding criminality is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-labeling-theory" href="part0048_split_006.html#labeling-theory">labeling theory</a>. It was originally associated with Howard S. Becker’s (1963) studies <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_206" title="206"></span>of marijuana smokers. In the early 1960s, marijuana use was a marginal activity of subcultures rather than the lifestyle choice—an activity accepted by many in the mainstream of society—it is today (Hathaway, 1997). Becker found that becoming a marijuana smoker depended on one’s acceptance by, and close association with, experienced users, as well as on one’s attitudes toward nonusers. Because labeling theorists such as Becker interpret deviance as a process of interaction between deviants and nondeviants, it is not the act of marijuana smoking that makes one a deviant but the way others react to it. Thus, to understand the nature of deviance itself, labeling theorists seek to discover why some people become labeled “deviant.”</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">People who represent law and order or who impose definitions of morality on others do most of the labeling. Thus, the rules by which deviance is defined express the power structure of society; such rules are framed by the wealthy for the poor, by men for women, by older people for younger people, and by ethnic majorities for minority groups. For example, many children wander into other people’s gardens, steal fruit, or skip school. In an affluent neighborhood, parents, teachers, and police might regard such activities as relatively innocent. However, when they are committed by children in poor areas, they might be considered acts of juvenile delinquency.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Once a child is labeled a delinquent, he or she is stigmatized as a deviant and is likely to be considered untrustworthy by teachers and prospective employers. The child then relapses into further criminal behavior, widening the gulf between himself and orthodox social conventions. Edwin Lemert (1972) called the initial act of transgression <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-primary-deviation" href="part0048_split_006.html#primary-deviation">primary deviation</a>. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-secondary-deviation" href="part0048_split_006.html#secondary-deviation">Secondary deviation</a> occurs when the individual accepts the label and sees himself as deviant. Research has shown that how we think of ourselves and how we believe others perceive us influence our propensity for committing crime. One study of a random national sample of young men showed that such negative self-appraisals are strongly tied to levels of criminality; in other words, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_207" title="207"></span>the perception that one is deviant may in fact motivate deviant behavior (Matsueda, 1992).</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">According to conflict theorists, laws are not applied evenly across the population, with law enforcement targeting less powerful members of society such as drug users. Here, a member of a narcotics task force plans a drug bust.</figcaption>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Consider Luke, who smashes a shop window while out on the town with friends. The act may be called the accidental result of overly boisterous behavior. Luke might escape with a reprimand and a small fine—a likely result if he is from a respectable background and is seen as being of good character. The window smashing stays at the level of primary deviance. If, however, the police and courts hand out a suspended sentence and make Luke report to a social worker, the incident could become the first step on the road to secondary deviance. Forced to report to a law enforcement official, Luke may begin to see himself as a delinquent and act in ways that fit with this self-perception. The process of “learning to be deviant” tends to be reinforced by the very organizations set up to correct deviant behavior: prisons and social agencies.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Labeling theory assumes that no act is intrinsically criminal but may become so through the formulation of laws and their interpretation by police, courts, and correctional institutions. Although some critics of labeling theory argue that certain acts—such as murder, rape, and robbery—are prohibited across all cultures, this view is surely incorrect. Even within our own culture, killing is not always regarded as murder. In times of war, killing the enemy is approved, and, until recently, the laws in most U.S. states did not recognize sexual intercourse forced on a woman by her husband as rape.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We can more convincingly criticize labeling theory on other grounds. First, labeling theorists neglect the underlying processes that lead to the acts that are subsequently defined as deviant. Indeed, labeling certain activities as deviant is not arbitrary; differences in socialization, attitudes, and opportunities influence how far people engage in behavior likely to be labeled deviant. For instance, children from deprived backgrounds are on average more likely to steal than are richer children. It is not the labeling that leads them to steal so much as their background.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Second, it is not clear whether labeling actually has the effect of increasing deviant conduct. Delinquent behavior tends to increase after a conviction, but is this the result of the labeling itself? Other factors, such as increased interaction with other delinquents or learning about new criminal opportunities, may be involved.</p>
