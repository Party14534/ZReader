<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">Global Perspectives: Education and Literacy in the Developing World</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">You have already learned about vast educational inequalities in the United States. However, from a global perspective, another disparity is of tremendous concern: cross-national disparities in literacy. Without literacy, schooling cannot proceed; it is the “baseline” of education. We take it for granted in the West that the majority of people are literate, but this is only a recent development in Western history, and in previous times, no more than a tiny proportion of the population had any literacy skills.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, roughly 14 percent of the world population over the age of 15, or 786 million persons, is illiterate—two-thirds of whom are women (World Bank, 2018c). However, younger generations are faring better than their parents; youth literacy rates in nearly every region of the world are higher than adult literacy rates—although these generational gaps vary widely by region. Youth literacy rates refer to persons ages 15 to 24, while adult literacy rates apply to the population age 15 and older. Worldwide, the lowest literacy rates are observed in sub-Saharan Africa (65 percent of adults and 77 percent of youth) and in South and West Asia (74 percent of adults and 91 percent of youth) (Global Map 16.1) (UNICEF, 2019a). However, even within regions, there is great heterogeneity; for example, adult literacy rates range from just 30 percent in Guinea to 95 percent in Equatorial Guinea. By contrast, East Asia, Central Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe enjoy literacy rates of nearly 100 percent (UNESCO, 2017b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What accounts for these marked gaps in global literacy rates? Sociologists believe that these patterns are best understood in a historical perspective and reflect enduring consequences of colonialism. During the period of colonialism, governments regarded education with some trepidation. Until the twentieth century, most colonial governments believed indigenous populations were too primitive to be worth educating. Later, education was seen as a way of making local elites responsive to European interests and ways of life. But, to some extent, the result was to spark discontent and rebellion. The majority of those who led anticolonial and nationalist movements were educated elites who had attended schools or colleges in Europe; they were able to compare firsthand the democratic institutions of the European countries with the absence of democracy in their lands of origin.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The education that the colonizers introduced usually pertained to Europe, not the colonial areas themselves. Educated Africans in the British colonies knew about the kings and queens of England and read Shakespeare and Milton, but they knew next to nothing about their own countries’ histories or past cultural achievements. Policies of educational reform since the end of colonialism have not completely altered the situation, even today.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Despite significant gains in reducing global illiteracy rates, more than 750 million adults worldwide still lack basic reading and writing skills. More than half of the global illiterate population reside in Southern Asia and another quarter live in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Partly as a result of the legacy of colonial education, which was not directed toward the majority of the population, the educational system in many developing countries is top-heavy: Higher education is disproportionately developed relative to primary and secondary education. The result is a correspondingly overqualified group who, having attended colleges and universities, cannot find White-collar or professional jobs. Given the low level of industrial development, most of the better-paid positions are in government, and there are not enough of those to go around.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In recent years, some developing countries, recognizing the shortcomings of the curricula inherited from colonialism, have tried to redirect their educational programs toward the rural poor in an effort to raise literacy rates. They have had limited success because usually there is insufficient funding to pay for the scale of the necessary innovations. As a result, countries such as India have begun programs of self-help education. Communities draw on existing resources without creating demands for high levels of finance. Those who can read and write and who perhaps possess job skills are encouraged to take others on as apprentices, whom they coach in their spare time.</p>
