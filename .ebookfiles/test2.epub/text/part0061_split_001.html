<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Neoliberal Theories</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-neoliberalism" href="part0061_split_006.html#neoliberalism">Neoliberalism</a> refers to the belief that the best economic consequences will result if individuals are entirely free from governmental constraint to make their own economic decisions. Government bureaucracy should not dictate which goods to produce, what prices to charge, how much to pay workers, or whether businesses should be prevented from polluting the environment. Such decisions should be left to the businesses themselves, who will respond to what the market demands: You, the consumer, freely choose from among competing brands, perhaps taking into account the working and environmental conditions under which the product is made. Neoliberal economic theories assume that, in the long run, everyone will be better off if such economic freedom is maximized.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The word “liberal” in “neoliberalism” refers to freedom—in this case, the freedom for producers and consumers alike to make their own economic decisions. It became a part of economic thinking with the publication of Adam Smith’s <i class="italic">The Wealth of Nations</i> in 1776, which argued that unrestricted industrial capitalism (which was then emerging) was the best avenue to economic growth. Liberal theories dominated economic belief until the 1930s, when the worldwide Great Depression caused the United States and other industrialized economies to question the belief that governments should play little or no role in the economy. A new economic theory called <i class="italic">Keynesianism</i>, which reflected the ideas presented in John Maynard Keynes’s 1936 book <i class="italic">The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</i>, called for a greatly expanded role of government in order to repair the economic damage done by the Great Depression. These ideas held sway for a half century. By the 1960s, the United States was providing Social Security pensions for retirees, health insurance for the elderly (Medicare) and the poor (Medicaid), insurance for those who lose their jobs, and welfare programs for the very poor, as well as a host of regulations aimed at protecting consumers, workers, and the environment. By the mid-twentieth century, it was generally accepted in the United States and other industrialized nations that supposedly “free markets” did not necessarily produce the best outcomes for everyone: Left unregulated, markets could favor the rich and powerful, lead to recurring economic crises, and produce a widening gap between rich and poor.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">During the second half of the twentieth century, however, the old liberal economic ideas enjoyed a resurgence (hence the prefix “neo,” or “new,” in “neoliberalism”). Their success was due in large part to a small group of highly influential University of Chicago economists, whose ideas resonated with businesses and conservative politicians (Overtveldt, 2009; Valdes, 2008). These ideas helped to shape U.S. policies regarding low-income countries, especially in neighboring Latin America, where widespread poverty had made communism appealing to many peasants and workers. One strategy to counter such appeal, in the view of U.S. policymakers, was to help foster neoliberal capitalism in low-income countries, which would hopefully result in economic growth and thereby dampen the appeal of communism. The key was for these countries to open their borders to U.S. financed foreign-aid programs that provided money, expert advisers, and technology to low-income countries, paving the way for U.S. corporations to make investments there (Berger, 1986; Ranis, 1996; Ranis and Mahmood, 1992; Rostow, 1961; Warren, 1980).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One influential proponent of such theories was W. W. Rostow, an economic adviser to former U.S. president John F. Kennedy, whose ideas helped shape U.S. foreign policy toward Latin America during the 1960s. Rostow’s explanation, termed <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-modernization-theory" href="part0061_split_006.html#modernization-theory">modernization theory</a>, argued that low-income societies could become “modern” (which meant resembling the United States and other high-income countries) only if they adopted modern economic institutions, technologies, and cultural values that emphasize savings and productive investment. According to Rostow (1961), the social institutions and traditional cultural values of low-income countries impeded their economic growth. One problem, it was argued, was that low-income countries’ economies were overregulated by ineffective and often corrupt governments. Another concern was that their populations had cultural values favoring living for today rather than investing in the future, under the belief that poverty somehow reflected God’s will. For low-income countries to “modernize,” they needed to reduce the power and influence of corrupt government officials, jettison their traditional values and institutions, and invest in the future. The United States could facilitate this by providing low-cost loans for electrification, road and airport construction; providing technical assistance in the form of teachers, economic advisers, lawyers, and other consultants; and—importantly—get these countries to encourage U.S. firms to invest in factories and large-scale agricultural production. Opening low-income country economies to U.S. corporate investment was seen as key to economic growth. Rostow used an aeronautical metaphor that policy makers could easily understand to make his case. He argued that “traditional societies” could “take off” into sustained economic growth if they followed his prescriptions, finally achieving the “modern” stage he termed “high mass consumption.” This transition would occur when countries invested at least 10 percent of their GNI into productive economic activities—under strict U.S. tutelage, of course.</p>
