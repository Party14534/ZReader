<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Understanding the Modern World: The Sociological Debate</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">From Marx’s time to the present, many sociological debates have centered on Marx’s ideas about the influence of economics on the development of modern societies. According to Marx, the stimulus for social change in the modern era resides in the pressure toward constant economic transformation produced by the spread of capitalist production.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Capitalism is a vastly more dynamic economic system than any other that preceded it. Capitalists compete to sell their goods to consumers; to survive in a competitive market, firms have to produce their wares as cheaply and efficiently as possible. This competition leads to constant technological innovation because increasing the effectiveness of the technology used in a particular production process is one way in which companies can secure an edge over their rivals. There are also strong incentives to seek new markets in which to sell goods, acquire inexpensive raw materials, and make use of cheap labor power. Capitalism, therefore, according to Marx, is a restlessly expanding system pushing outward across the world. This is how Marx explained the global spread of Western industry.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Subsequent Marxist authors have refined Marx’s portrayal. However, numerous critics have set out to rebut Marx’s view, offering alternative analyses of the influences shaping the modern world. Virtually everyone accepts that capitalism has played a major part, but other sociologists have argued that Marx exaggerated the effect of purely economic factors in producing change and that capitalism is less central to modern social development than he claimed. Most of these writers have also been skeptical of Marx’s belief that a socialist system would eventually replace capitalism.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of Marx’s earliest and most acute critics was Max Weber, whose alternative position remains important today. According to Weber, noneconomic factors have played the key role in modern social development. Weber’s celebrated work <i class="italic">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i> (1977; orig. 1904) proposes that religious values—especially those associated with Puritanism—were of fundamental importance in creating a capitalistic outlook. This outlook did not emerge, as Marx had supposed, only from economic changes.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Weber’s understanding of the nature of modern societies, and the reasons for the spread of Western ways of life across the world, also contrasts substantially with that of Marx. According to Weber, capitalism—a distinct way of organizing economic enterprise—is one among other major factors shaping social development in the modern period. Underlying these capitalist mechanisms, and in some ways more fundamental than those mechanisms, is the effect of science and bureaucracy. Science has shaped modern technology and will presumably do so in any future society, whether socialist or capitalist. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_19" title="19"></span>Bureaucracy is the only way of organizing large numbers of people effectively and therefore inevitably expands with economic and political growth. The developments of science, modern technology, and bureaucracy are examples of a general social process that Weber referred to collectively as <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-rationalization" href="part0011_split_004.html#rationalization">rationalization</a>. Rationalization means the organization of social, economic, and cultural life according to principles of efficiency, on the basis of technical knowledge.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Which interpretation of modern societies, that deriving from Marx or that coming from Weber, is correct? Scholars are divided on the issue. Moreover, within each camp are variations, so not every theorist agrees with all the points of one interpretation. The contrasts between these two standpoints inform many areas of sociology.</p>
