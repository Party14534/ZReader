<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">How Are Late-Modern Organizations Reinventing Themselves?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For quite a long while in Western societies, Weber’s model, closely mirrored by Foucault’s, held fast. In government, hospital administration, universities, and business organizations, bureaucracy was dominant. Even though, as Peter Blau showed, informal social groups always develop in bureaucratic settings, and are in fact effective, it seemed as though the future might be what Weber had anticipated: constantly increasing bureaucratization.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Bureaucracies still exist in the West, but Weber’s idea that a clear hierarchy of authority, with power and knowledge concentrated at the top, is the only way to run a large organization is starting to look archaic. Numerous organizations are overhauling themselves to become less, rather than more, hierarchical.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the 1960s, Burns and Stalker concluded that traditional bureaucratic structures could stifle innovation and creativity in cutting-edge industries. In today’s electronic economy, few would dispute these findings. Departing from rigid vertical command structures, many organizations are turning to “horizontal,” collaborative models to become more responsive to fluctuating markets. In this section, we examine some of the forces behind these shifts, including globalization and information technology, and consider some of the ways in which late-modern organizations are reinventing themselves.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Anyone who draws money from a bank or buys an airline ticket depends on a computer-based communication system. Because data can be processed instantaneously in any part of the world linked to such a system, there is no need for physical proximity among those involved. As a result, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-information-and-communication-technology" href="part0044_split_004.html#information-and-communication-technology">information and communication technology</a> has allowed many companies to reengineer their organizational structures (Attaran, 2004; Bresnahan et al., 2002; Castells, 2000, 2001; Kanter, 1991; Kobrin, 1997; Zuboff, 1988). Such changes, while good for efficiency, can have negative as well as positive consequences for the individuals within the organization.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For example, one company found the sales of some of its products falling and needed to reduce costs. The traditional route would have been to lay off staff. Instead, the firm set up as independent consultants those <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_190" title="190"></span>who would have been laid off. The company then bought back a substantial proportion of the former employees’ working time for a number of years but also left them free to work for other clients. The idea was that the new arrangement would provide the corporation with access to the skills of its former employees but at a cheaper rate because it no longer provided office space or company benefits (pension, health insurance, and so on). The former employees, in turn, had the opportunity to build up their own businesses. Initially, at least, the arrangement has worked well for both parties. In such a scheme, though, the burden is on the former employees, because they have to compensate for the loss of benefits with new business.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This is just one example of how large organizations have become more decentralized and flexible (Burris, 1998). Another example is the rise of telecommuting. A good deal of office work can now be carried out by remote workers using the Internet and other mobile technologies, such as smartphones and tablets, to work at home or somewhere other than their employer’s primary office. In 2016, 43 percent of workers spent some time working remotely, while 20 percent of employees worked remotely all of the time. People are also spending more time working remotely: Currently, nearly one-third of remote workers are working outside the office 80 percent or more of the time, up from about a quarter of workers in 2012 (Gallup, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We see the highest proportions of remote workers in industries such as transportation and computer/information systems as well as arts, design, entertainment, and media. Remote workers are typically older (50+) and college educated, and they work in salaried professional or managerial positions.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">To reduce costs and increase productivity, large firms may set up information networks connecting employees who work from home with the main office. In 2009, the computer company Cisco released a study of its own employees, which found that <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_191" title="191"></span>telecommuting significantly increased productivity, work-life flexibility, and job satisfaction. The company reportedly accrued annual savings of $277 million in productivity by allowing employees to telecommute and telework. In addition to productivity gains, Cisco estimates that its telework and telecommuting policies have resulted in a reduction of the company’s carbon footprint, saving approximately 47,320 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions due to avoided travel (Cisco, 2009). It is estimated that if all the workers whose jobs are compatible with working at home could do so, the savings would total over $700 billion each year and reduce the need for Persian Gulf oil imports by 37 percent (Global Workplace Analytics, 2014).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One reason that telecommuting increases productivity is that it eliminates commuting time, thereby permitting greater concentration of energy on work. Hartig, Johansson, and Kylin (2003) found that telecommuters actually spend more time on paid work when working at home than their counterparts do when working in the office. Employers view these longer hours as a primary benefit of telecommuting (International Telework Association and Council, 2004). However, these new work arrangements are not perfect. First, the employees lose the human side of work; computer monitors are no substitute for face-to-face interaction with colleagues and friends at work. Second, telecommuters experience isolation, distraction, and conflicting demands of work and home responsibilities (Ammons and Markham, 2004). In addition, female telecommuters face more stress from increased housework and child-care responsibilities (Ammons and Markham, 2004; Olson, 1989; Olson and Primps, 1984). In recent years, however, some large corporations have opted to buck this trend in remote work by terminating or scaling back their work-from-home policies, including Best Buy, Yahoo, and Bank of America, citing an effort to boost collaboration and communication (Gallup, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">On the other hand, management cannot easily monitor employees working off-site (Dimitrova, 2003; Kling, 1996). While this lack of supervision may create problems for employers, it allows employees greater flexibility in managing their nonwork roles, thus contributing to increased worker satisfaction (Davis and Polonko, 2001). Telecommuting also creates new possibilities for older and disabled workers to remain independent, productive, and socially connected (Bricourt, 2004). Finally, telecommuting is contributing to new trends in housing and residential development as space for home offices becomes more of a priority. With people able to work at a distance from city centers, residential development no longer needs to be tied to commuting practices.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While computerization has resulted in increased flexibility and a reduction in hierarchy, it has created a two-tier occupational structure composed of technical “experts” and less-skilled production or clerical workers. In these restructured organizations, jobs have been redefined more in terms of technical skill than rank or position. For expert professionals, traditional bureaucratic constraints are relaxed to allow for creativity and flexibility (Burris, 1993). Although professionals benefit from this expanded autonomy, computerization makes production and service workers more visible and vulnerable to supervision (Wellman et al., 1996; Zuboff, 1988). For instance, organizations can now monitor work patterns to the point where they can count the number of seconds per phone call or keystrokes per minute, which in turn can lead to higher levels of stress for employees.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_192" title="192"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Granted, workplace computerization does have some positive effects. It has made some of the mundane tasks of clerical jobs more interesting. It can also promote social networking (Wellman et al., 1996). Office computers can be used for recreation; private exchanges with coworkers, friends, or family; and work-related interaction. And, as in the case of telecommuting, computerization can contribute to greater flexibility for workers to manage both their personal and professional lives.</p>
