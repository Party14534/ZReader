<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Low-income countries, the world’s poorest, have mostly agricultural economies; some are just beginning to industrialize. Scholars debate the reasons for their late industrialization and widespread poverty, as we will see later. They include much of eastern, western, and sub-Saharan Africa; North Korea in East Asia; Nepal in South Asia; and Haiti in the Caribbean. In 2018, the low-income countries were home to 9 percent of the world’s population (roughly 705 million people) but just 0.1 percent of the world’s GNI; the average annual income for people living in these countries was only $841 in 2018, one-fiftieth the amount of persons living in high-income countries. Moreover, this inequality is increasing—partly as a result of higher fertility. In fact, there is an inverse relationship between income level and population growth: In general, the poorer the country, the faster the growth in population. Between 2000 and 2018, the population of high-income countries increased 12 percent, while that of low-income countries increased 61 percent (World Bank, 2019e). While the rates of population growth are predicted to slow over the coming years for all income categories of countries, between 2018 and 2028 the number of people living in low-income countries is predicted to grow more than nine times faster than the number of people living in high-income countries (29 percent vs. 3 percent) (World Bank, 2019d). In poorer countries, large families are more likely to be a cultural norm because children can be an economic asset. They contribute to household and family farm labor, and they are increasingly likely to work in factories as well. (In wealthy countries, smaller <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_293" title="293"></span>families are the norm: in most families children do not typically contribute to household income, but instead depend on their parents’ earnings for their lifestyles.) In many low-income countries, people struggle with poverty, malnutrition, and starvation. Most people live in rural areas, although in recent years, hundreds of millions of people have been moving to densely populated cities, where they live either in dilapidated housing or on the streets (see <a href="part0121_split_000.html#3JCK20-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
