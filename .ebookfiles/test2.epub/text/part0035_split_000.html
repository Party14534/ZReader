<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When we published the first edition of this book, the study of face-to-face communication was a well-settled territory. There is reason to think, however, that social interaction over the past decade or so has undergone a major transformation because of the Internet. In this chapter, we will review the traditional findings of the field, but we will also ask how we must modify those findings in light of the rise of email, Twitter, iPhone apps, and social networking sites like Facebook. We will first learn about the ways we use impression management techniques in our daily interactions. We then move on to analyze the nonverbal cues (facial expressions and bodily gestures) all of us use when interacting with one another. Finally, we focus on the ways in which our lives are structured by daily routines, paying particular attention to how we coordinate our actions across space and time.</p>
