<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Internet transcends national and cultural borders, facilitating the global spread of ideas. More and more people worldwide access the Internet regularly and consider it important to their lifestyles. According to one service that tracks global Internet usage, as of 2019, more than 4.3 billion people were using the Internet in some form—approximately 56 percent of the world’s population. Internet use, of course, reflects global inequalities as well: 86 percent of people living in developed countries are Internet users, compared with 47 percent in developing countries, and 19 percent in least developed countries. Still, this picture is rapidly changing: Internet usage in Africa has grown to 28 percent, more than two and half times the rate of Internet usage in 2010—by far the highest rate of increase in the world (International Telecommunications Union [ITU], 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While a January 2017 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 88 percent of Americans report using the Internet, those most likely to do so are young (100 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29, compared with only 73 percent of people 65 and older), relatively wealthy (98 percent of those earning over $75,000, compared with 82 percent of those earning less than $30,000), and educated (98 percent of those with a college education, compared with only 71 percent of those without a high school diploma). Racial differences were almost nonexistent, with 92 percent of Whites using the Internet, compared with 86 percent of Hispanics, and 85 percent of African Americans (Pew Research Center, 2019b). Americans increasingly use the Internet on an array of devices and gadgets. In 2019, 81 percent of adults in the United States owned a smartphone. Younger people—those ages 18 to 29—are much more likely to use smartphones (96 percent) than people 65 and older (53 percent) (Pew Research Center, 2019e).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Internet is replacing television and newspapers as the principal source for news for a growing number of people. Nearly half of all Americans with access to the Internet report getting news about government and politics from Facebook (43 percent)—roughly the same number as do from local TV (49 percent), and more than from CNN (44 percent), Fox News (39 percent), or NBC News (37 percent) (Pew Research Center, 2016f; Geiger, 2019). Does this easy access to the world’s information result in greater open-mindedness—an ability to find information that challenges one’s pet beliefs, thereby contributing to the free exchange of ideas ideally associated with democracy? This answer is far from clear-cut. While the Internet may democratize access to wide-ranging sources, most people get their news and information from Internet sources that reinforce their beliefs. On Facebook, for example, politically related postings are likely to come from like-minded friends (Pew Research Center, 2016f).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While the Internet (especially social media) played a major role in the 2016 presidential election, television still proved to be a more important source of information. During the presidential primaries, 62 percent of Trump supporters reported that they got most of their election news from television, compared with only 28 percent who relied on news websites and social media. For those supporting Clinton, the corresponding figures were similar: 56 percent and 28 percent. Yet nearly half (48 percent) of all Democrats who supported someone other than Clinton relied on news websites <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_479" title="479"></span>and social media, as opposed to television (37 percent)—a result that most likely reflected young persons’ support for Sanders (Gottfried, Barthel, and Mitchell, 2017). Perhaps not surprisingly, the percentage of adults who report they often get their news online decreases with age: For Americans 18–49, the figure is roughly half; it drops to 29 percent for those 50–64, and 20 percent for those over 65 (Mitchell at al., 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Both as candidate and now as president, Trump has used Twitter to mobilize his supporters. During the primaries, one study found that during one three-week period, Trump, Clinton, and Sanders posted roughly the same number of times on both Facebook and Twitter, but that Trump’s postings produced by far the greatest response. His tweets, for example, were retweeted on average 6,000 times; Sanders was retweeted 2,500 times, and Clinton 1,500 times. At the time, Trump had roughly 10 million followers on Twitter and nearly as many on Facebook, both greatly exceeding the numbers for Clinton and Sanders (Pew Research Center, 2016b). After he was elected president, his number of Twitter followers rapidly increased, once it became clear that he was not abandoning his favorite medium as a principal means of communication. President Trump now has more than 32 million Twitter followers on his personal account and another 18 million on his presidential account (although many are likely on both) (Presto, Gingras, and Welch, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Trump’s use of Twitter, which clearly outstrips any president (and most likely any other U.S. political figure), provided him with direct access to his strongest supporters, bypassing the more mainstream print and television news outlets. Because his tweets were often provocative and controversial, they were frequently covered by the mainstream media, enabling Trump to reach an even wider audience. One study of Trump’s speeches and tweets during the presidential primaries, a time when he and his rival Republican candidates were vying for the support of the conservative Republican base, partly attributed his primary win to the fact that he used Twitter more than the other candidates. The study also flagged his communication style as key: grandiose pronouncements about himself, his plans, and his ability to make sweeping changes; his use of first-person pronouns; and the dynamic, nonverbal aspects of his speeches (Ahmadian, Azarshahi, and Paulhus, 2017). Twitter limits its posts to 140 characters, encouraging the use of short words and simple statements, roughly the length of this sentence. While this limitation clearly does not favor complex political analyses of challenging issues, it is well adapted to simplicity, impulsiveness, and—all too often—incivility: debasing attacks rather than reasoned discourse (Ott, 2017).</p>
