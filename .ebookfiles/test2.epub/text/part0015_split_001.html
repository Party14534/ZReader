<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When was the last time you posted on a friend’s Facebook page, liked a photo, or changed your relationship status? Many of us use social networking to keep up with friends and family and share details about our lives with a wider audience. Indeed, Facebook not only allows us to keep up with those we care about, but it also serves as a detailed record of our social relationships.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In recent years, scholars have taken data from our Facebook pages to ask questions about whom we interact with, whom we befriend, and whom we love. One study claimed that Facebook could predict whether our romantic relationships would last. To make this argument, they drew on a large dataset of more than 1 million individuals in romantic relationships, as well as their Facebook friends—a total of nearly 380 million Facebook users. They found that if two people were romantic partners, and their friendship groups overlapped a great deal, meaning they had the same group of friends, they had a higher likelihood of staying together (Backstrom and Kleinberg, 2013).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">If your answer to the question on the previous page was that sociology today relies more and more on studies that, like this one, use big data, then you are correct. Increasingly, studies are relying on statistical or <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-quantitative-methods" href="part0015_split_002.html#quantitative-methods">quantitative methods</a> and computer programs that make it possible to analyze the vast amounts of data the Internet generates. These methods allow sociologists to process more data than ever before.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Even as we reap all the scientific potential that can be seen in the age of big data, we must also contend with its potential arrogance. Some researchers feel more confident than ever before in the claims that can be made from big datasets. Researchers who have never been to a slum, nor have any personal relationship to a single poor person, feel they can speak with authority about inequality and poverty from a study based on interesting statistical correlations. In the age of big data, empathy and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_33" title="33"></span>involvement with communities and people under study are less frequently the basis of social scientific insights. But if you answered <i class="italic">b</i>—sociology has no place for empathy—that would not be correct either.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociology has a rich tradition that also includes <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-qualitative-methods" href="part0015_split_002.html#qualitative-methods">qualitative methods</a>, which rely on observations, interviews, and archival data. Here, personal involvement and empathy count for a great deal, though most of the insights in qualitative studies also derive from other kinds of sociological thinking. While quantitative analyses may make use of numerical data (such as that collected in surveys or Facebook friend lists), qualitative analyses may use data derived from interactions, interviews, conversations, or observations of a social scene. For example, a qualitative study of the same question asked in the Facebook study of romantic relationships might use fewer cases to focus on richer details of how individuals dissolve their relationships. In <i class="italic">Uncoupling</i>, Diane Vaughan (1986) explored this question by using interviews with people who broke up to better understand how relationships end.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Does the reliance on qualitative methods make sociology less of a science? It does not. Do quantitative methods make sociology more scientific? They do not. When many people think of a “science,” they typically imagine fields like physics or chemistry. Yet, as we shall see, what makes chemistry and physics a science is not the sample size or even the subject matter, but rather a set of values that can be deployed in any research. In this chapter, we begin by discussing those values to clarify the meaning of <i class="italic">science</i> in social science.</p>
