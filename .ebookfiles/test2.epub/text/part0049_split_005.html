<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Does American society really have more crime than other societies? Most TV and newspaper reporting is based on official crime statistics the police collect and the government publishes. Most of these reports are based on two sources: Uniform Crime Reports and victimization studies. Each has its own limitations and offers only a partial portrait of crime in American life.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) contain official data on crime that is reported to law enforcement agencies across the country that then provide the data to the FBI. UCR <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_218" title="218"></span>focus on “index crimes,” which include serious crimes such as murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, robbery, forcible rape, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny/theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson (Figure 7.5). Critics of UCR note that the reports do not accurately reflect crime rates because they include only those crimes reported to law enforcement agencies; they don’t, for example, include crimes reported to other agencies, such as the IRS. Some argue that by excluding crimes traditionally committed by middle-class persons, such as fraud and embezzlement, UCR reify the belief that crime is an activity of ethnic minorities and the poor.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because UCR focus narrowly on crimes reported to the police, criminologists also rely on self-reports, or reports provided by the crime victims themselves. This second source of data is essential because some criminologists think that about half of all serious crimes, such as robbery with violence, go unreported. The proportion of less serious crimes that go unreported, especially small thefts, is even higher. Since 1973, the U.S. Bureau of the Census has been interviewing households across the country in its National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which confirms that the overall rate of crime is higher than the index of reported crime. For instance, in 2018, less than 50 percent of violent crime was reported (43 percent), including just 33 percent of rape or sexual assaults, 62 percent of robberies, and 42 percent of simple assaults. Auto theft—a form of property crime—is the crime most frequently reported to the police (69 percent) (Gramlich, 2019a; Truman and Morgan, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Public concern in the United States focuses on crimes of violence—murder, assault, and rape—even though only about 13 percent of all crimes are violent (Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI], 2016a). According to the FBI’s 2018 Crime in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_219" title="219"></span>United States Report, 1.2 million violent crimes occurred in the United States in 2018 (Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI], 2018a). In the United States, the most common victims of murder and other violent crimes (with the exception of rape) are young, poor African American men in larger cities. The rate of murder among Black male teenagers is more than five times the rate for their White counterparts, although this disparity has declined in recent years. In general, whether indexed by police statistics or the National Crime Victimization Survey, violent crimes, such as burglary and car theft, are more common in cities than in suburbs and more common in suburbs than in smaller towns. The most likely explanation for the overall high level of violent crime in the United States is a combination of the availability of firearms, the general influence of the frontier tradition, and the subcultures of violence in the large cities.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A notable feature of most crimes of violence is their mundane character. Most assaults and homicides bear little resemblance to the murderous, random acts of gunmen or the carefully planned homicides highlighted in the media. Murders generally happen in the context of family and other interpersonal relationships; the victim usually knows the murderer.</p>
