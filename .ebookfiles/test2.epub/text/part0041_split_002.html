<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Much of importance in life occurs through some type of social group. You and your roommate make up a social group, as do the members of your introductory sociology <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_170" title="170"></span>class. A <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-group" href="part0041_split_005.html#social-group">social group</a> is a collection of people who have a common identity and who regularly interact with one another on the basis of shared expectations concerning behavior. People who belong to the same social group identify with one another, expect one another to conform to certain ways of thinking and acting, and recognize the boundaries that separate them from other groups or people. In our need to congregate and belong, we have created a rich and varied group life that gives us our norms, practices, and values—our whole way of life.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We sometimes feel alone, yet we are seldom far from one kind of group or another. Every day, nearly all of us move through various social situations. We hang out with friends, study with classmates, play team sports, and go online to meet people who share our interests.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">But just being in one another’s company does not make a collection of individuals a social group. People milling around in crowds, waiting for a bus, or strolling on a beach make up what is called a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-aggregate" href="part0041_split_005.html#social-aggregate">social aggregate</a>—a collection of people who happen to be together in a particular place but do not significantly interact or identify with one another. People waiting together at a bus station, for example, may be aware of one another, but they are unlikely to think of themselves as a “we”—the group waiting for the next bus to Poughkeepsie or Des Moines. By the same token, people may make up a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-category" href="part0041_split_005.html#social-category">social category</a>—people sharing a common characteristic such as gender or occupation—without necessarily interacting or identifying with one another. The sense of belonging to a common social group is missing.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Group life differs greatly in how intensely members experience it. Beginning with the family—the first group to which most of us belong—many of the groups that shape our personalities and lives are those in which we experience strong emotional ties. This is common not only for families but also for groups of friends, including gangs and other peer groups, all of which are known as primary groups. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-primary-groups" href="part0041_split_005.html#primary-groups">Primary groups</a> are small groups characterized by face-to-face interaction, intimacy, and a strong sense of commitment. Members of primary groups often experience unity, a merging of the self with the group into one personal “we.” The sociologist Charles Horton Cooley (1864–1929) termed such groups “primary” because he believed that they were the basic form of association, exerting a long-lasting influence on the development of our social selves (Cooley, 1964; orig. 1902).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In contrast, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-secondary-groups" href="part0041_split_005.html#secondary-groups">secondary groups</a> are large and impersonal and seldom involve intense emotional ties, enduring relationships, powerful commitments to the group itself, or a feeling of unity. Examples of secondary groups include businesses, schools, work groups, athletic clubs, and governmental bodies. We rarely feel we can be ourselves in <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_171" title="171"></span>a secondary group; rather, we are often playing a role, such as employee or student. Cooley argued that while people belong to primary groups mainly because membership is fulfilling, people join secondary groups to achieve a specific goal: to earn a living, get a college degree, or compete on a sports team. Secondary groups may become primary groups. For example, when students taking a course together socialize after class, they create bonds of friendship that constitute a primary group.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For most of human history, nearly all interactions took place within primary groups. This pattern began to change with the emergence of larger agrarian societies, which included such secondary groups as those based on governmental roles or occupations. Today, most of our waking hours are spent within secondary groups, although primary groups remain a basic part of our lives.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some early sociologists, such as Cooley, worried about a loss of intimacy as more and more interactions revolved around large, impersonal organizations. However, what Cooley saw as the growing impersonality and anonymity of modern life may also offer increasing tolerance of individual differences. Primary groups often enforce strict conformity to group standards (Durkheim, 1964; orig. 1893; Simmel, 1955). Secondary groups are more likely to be concerned with accomplishing a task than with enforcing conformity.</p>
