<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">The Chicago School</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Two concepts developed by the “Chicago School” are worthy of special attention. One is the so-called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-ecological-approach" href="part0123_split_005.html#ecological-approach">ecological approach</a> to urban analysis (Park, 1952); the other is the characterization of urbanism as a <i class="italic">way of life</i>, developed by Wirth (1938). It is important to understand these ideas as the Chicago School initially conceived of them and to see how sociologists in more recent decades have revised and even replaced them.</p>
<section id="urban-ecology">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Urban Ecology</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">Ecology</i>—the study of the adaptation of plant and animal organisms to their environment—is a term taken from the physical sciences. The Chicago School believed that cities grew and took shape by adapting to their environments, much as is the case with plants and animals. Large urban areas initially tend to develop along the shores of rivers, in fertile plains, or at the intersection of trading routes or railways. They then become ordered into “natural areas” through such seemingly natural processes as competition, invasion, and succession—a set of concepts taken directly from biological ecology. Much like plants and animals in a natural environment, different neighborhoods develop through the adjustments inhabitants make as they struggle to gain their livelihoods. The Chicago School sought to show that cities grew outward in <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_771" title="771"></span>concentric rings: In the center are the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-inner-city" href="part0123_split_005.html#inner-city">inner-city</a> areas, a mixture of big-business prosperity and decaying private homes; beyond these are older established neighborhoods, housing workers employed in stable manual occupations; farther out still are the suburbs, in which higher-income groups tend to live. Processes of invasion and succession occur within the segments of the concentric rings. Thus, as property decays in a central or near-central area, ethnic minority groups might start to move into it. As they do so, more of the preexisting population starts to leave, precipitating a wholesale flight to neighborhoods elsewhere in the city or out to the suburbs. Within this larger framework, <i class="italic">differentiation</i> occurs—different groups will compete for space. For example, groups on which many others depend (banks, corporate headquarters, insurance companies) will have a dominant role, often reflected in their central geographical position; members of different ethnic groups may all live in certain neighborhoods, ranging from poor to wealthy depending on the fortunes of the group (Hawley, 1950, 1968). These processes were treated as immutable as the laws of nature, an assumption which might have provided some scientific credence to sociological reasoning, but which, as we shall see, often proved to be incorrect.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Cities are human-made and are therefore shaped by human—and not natural—forces. The assumptions of human ecology were challenged when two Black graduate students, drawing on extensive historical and ethnographic data, published the book <i class="italic">Black Metropolis</i> (Drake and Cayton, 1945). Their research showed that Chicago’s Black residential neighborhoods were <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-ghetto" href="part0123_split_005.html#ghetto">ghettos</a>, places where a racial or ethnic group initially comes to live as a consequence of systematic exclusion from more desirable places. Chicago’s ghettos, they argued, were by no means the result of “natural forces” but were instead shaped by unnatural social forces: Blacks had been given no <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_772" title="772"></span>choice but to live in the worst areas of the city. There was nothing natural about this placement, and it would not have occurred if not for social forces such as exclusion, violence, and restrictive covenants where neighborhood “improvement” associations passed laws making it illegal to sell land in a community to Blacks. After the publication of Drake and Cayton’s <i class="italic">Black Metropolis</i>, it was harder for sociologists to think of the distributions of populations in urban areas as natural.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Urbanism as a Way of Life</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Wirth’s thesis of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-urbanism" href="part0123_split_005.html#urbanism">urbanism</a> as a <i class="italic">way of life</i> (1938) focuses on the ways that life in cities is different from life elsewhere, but also helps to shape life outside cities—for example, by influencing styles of dress and behavior. As a “way of life,” however, cities are unique in that large numbers of people live in close proximity to one another in virtual anonymity, without knowing one another personally—a fundamental contrast to small, traditional villages. As a result, within cities most contact (for example, with sales clerks, baristas, passengers on trains) is fleeting and partial, serving as a means to other ends, rather than being a satisfying relationship in itself. Given the fast pace of life, the bonds that unite people tend to be weak; competition prevails over cooperation. Yet at the same time, some neighborhoods may preserve the characteristics of small communities—for example, among immigrant communities. The more such areas are absorbed into wider patterns of city life, however, the less these characteristics survive.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">Whether listening to music on portable devices or texting on their phones, many people have strategies for distancing themselves and managing social boundaries in busy urban environments.</figcaption>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_773" title="773"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Wirth was among the first to address the “urban interaction problem” (Duneier and Molotch, 1999), the necessity for city dwellers to respect social boundaries when so many people are in close physical proximity all the time. Wirth elaborates that “the reserve, the indifference, and the blasé outlook that urbanites manifest in their relationships may thus be regarded as devices for immunizing themselves against the personal claims and expectations of others.” Many people walk down the street in cities acting unconcerned about the others near them, often talking on cell phones or listening to music that blocks out the sounds of urban life. Through such appearance of apathy, they can avoid unwanted transgression of social boundaries.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Wirth’s ideas have deservedly enjoyed wide currency. The impersonal nature of many day-to-day contacts in modern cities is undeniable, but to some degree, this is true of social life in general in modern societies: Even in rural areas, people must manage social boundaries in their face-to-face interactions with others, as has been found as far afield as in western Samoa (Duranti, 1994) or among the African Poro people (Bellman, 1984). Furthermore, neighborhoods marked by close kinship and personal ties are not only the result of immigrant groups seeking to preserve their ethnic ties or previous ways of living; they can also result from the interaction among people who share common interests, whether it be religion, politics, language, or art and culture. A small town or village does not easily allow the development of such subcultural diversity (Fischer, 1984). An artist might find few others in a village or small town with whom to associate but may find a community of like-minded artistic or intellectual peers in neighborhoods such as Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York. Likewise, some gay and lesbian young people may find more hospitable communities in cities that have large gay subcultures, such as San Francisco, compared to the small towns where they may have grown up.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A large city may be a world of strangers, yet it supports and creates personal relationships. It may be difficult to meet people when one first moves to a large city, but given the diversity of people in large cities, opportunities exist to seek out and befriend like-minded individuals. By contrast, anyone moving to a small, established rural community may find one’s neighbors to be friendly and polite, but it may take years to become truly accepted when one is “new” in town. Wirth’s ideas retain some validity, but in light of subsequent contributions, they clearly are overgeneralized. Modern cities frequently involve impersonal, anonymous social relationships, but they are also sources of diversity—and, sometimes, intimacy.</p>
