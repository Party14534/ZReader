<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Does the Internet Promote a Global Culture?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many believe that the rapid worldwide growth of the Internet is hastening the spread of a global culture resembling the cultures of Europe and North America. Belief in such values as equality between men and women, the right to speak freely, democratic participation in government, and the pursuit of pleasure through consumption are diffused throughout the world over the Internet. Moreover, Internet technology itself seems to foster such values: Global communication, seemingly unlimited (and uncensored) information, and instant gratification all characterize the new technology.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet it may be premature to conclude that the Internet will sweep aside traditional cultures. Cyberspace is becoming increasingly global, and evidence shows that the Internet is, in many ways, compatible with traditional cultural values, perhaps even a means of strengthening them. This is especially likely to be true in countries that seek to control the Internet, censoring or blocking unwanted content and punishing those whose postings violate traditional values. One example is Saudi Arabia, a monarchy that officially enforces a highly conservative form of traditional Islam. The Saudi government not only routinely filters or blocks Internet content but also uses it to disseminate official propaganda. Content deemed “harmful, “anti-Islamic,” or “offensive” is blocked, including any criticism of the royal family, and messaging apps such as Telegram and WhatsApp are restricted. In order to sell its iPhone in the kingdom, Apple had to remove the device’s built-in FaceTime app. Social media is heavily monitored, and cyber dissidents—for example, those who defend women’s or minority rights <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_88" title="88"></span>or criticize traditional religious beliefs—are likely to receive steep fines and severe punishment. In 2016, a Saudi individual was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 2,000 lashes for “spreading atheism” on Twitter (Freedom House, 2016).</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">According to Freedom House, two-thirds of Internet users live in countries where criticism of the government is subject to censorship. In addition to censoring Facebook and Twitter, governments are increasingly targeting messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram.</figcaption>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet at the same time, even under such repressive conditions, the Internet provides a space for self-expression and discussion, albeit within limits. Saudis are some of the most active social media users in the world and are the largest adopters of Twitter in the Arab world. Women, for example, who comprise more than half of all Internet users in Saudi Arabia, are able to engage in Internet discussions that would be forbidden in public, such as those about women’s health issues.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Internet has sometimes been described as an echo chamber, in which people seek out like-minded others whose postings reinforce their own beliefs (Manjoo, 2008; Sunstein, 2012). For example, one study of a Jewish ultraorthodox religious group found that the Internet helped to strengthen the community, providing a forum for communication and the sharing of ideas (Barzilai-Nahon and Barzilai, 2005). In this sense, the Internet may be splitting society into what can be thought of as digitally linked tribes with their own unique cultural beliefs and values—sometimes even in conflict with the dominant culture. Examples from youth subcultures in recent years would include hippies, punks, skinheads, Rastas, Goths, gamers, rappers, and dancehall enthusiasts. Such subcultures sometimes emerge when ethnic minority youth seek to create a unique cultural identity within the dominant culture, often through music, dress, hairstyle, and bodily adornment such as tattoos and piercing. They are often hybrids of existing cultures: For example, dancehall, like reggae, which originated <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_89" title="89"></span>as part of a youth culture in Jamaica’s poor neighborhoods, today has spread to the United States, Europe, and anywhere there has been a large Caribbean migration (Niahh, 2010).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Finally, of course, the Internet can be used to build a community around ideas that directly threaten the dominant culture. Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other radical Islamist jihadists rely on the Internet to spread their ideas, attract new recruits, and organize acts of violence. Suicide bombers routinely make videos celebrating their imminent deaths, videos that are posted on jihadist websites (and occasionally even YouTube) to reach a wider audience of current and potential believers. Extremist groups from all faiths (Christian, Jewish, Muslim) have found the Internet to be a useful tool (Juergensmeyer, 2008).</p>
