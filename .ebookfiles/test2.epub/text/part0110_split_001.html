<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Marx, Weber, and Durkheim all wrote about religion but drew radically different conclusions. For Marx, religion was a form of false consciousness, blinding people to the underlying causes of inequality. Durkheim viewed religion as an important source of social solidarity, while Weber analyzed the relationship between religion and the emergence of capitalism.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Marx: Religion and Inequality</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Karl Marx never studied religion in any detail. His thinking on religion was derived mostly from the writings of Ludwig Feuerbach, who believed that through a process he called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-alienation" href="part0110_split_004.html#alienation">alienation</a>, human beings attribute their own culturally created values and norms to alien, or separate, beings (i.e., divine forces or gods) because they do not understand their own history. Thus, the story of the Ten Commandments given to Moses by God is a mythical version of the origins of moral precepts that govern the lives of Jewish and Christian believers.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Marx accepted Feuerbach’s view that religion represents human self-alienation. In a famous phrase, he declared that religion was the “opium of the people”:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is required for their real happiness. (Marx, 1994; orig. 1843–1844)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Religion defers happiness and rewards to the afterlife, Marx argued, teaching a resigned acceptance of conditions in the earthly life—including inequalities and injustices. Religion contains a strong ideological element: Religious belief can provide justifications for those in power. For example, “The meek shall inherit the earth” suggests humility and nonresistance to oppression. In Marx’s view, people had to shed their religious beliefs to better understand the social forces that were oppressing them. Only then, he argued, would people rise up, overthrow the oppressive order, and create a society that truly served their interests.</p>

<section id="durkheim-religion-and-functionalism">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Durkheim: Religion and Functionalism</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In contrast to Marx, Émile Durkheim extensively studied religion and connected religion not with social inequalities or power but with the overall nature of a society’s institutions. In <i class="italic">The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life</i> (1965; orig. 1912), Durkheim concentrated on <i class="italic">totemism</i>, the worship of objects such as animals or plants believed to embody mystical spirits. Durkheim studied totemism as practiced by Australian aboriginal societies, arguing that such totemism represented religion in its most “elementary” form.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Durkheim defined religion in terms of a distinction between the sacred and the profane. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-sacred" href="part0110_split_004.html#sacred">Sacred</a> objects and symbols, he held, are treated as apart from routine aspects of day-to-day existence—the realm of the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-profane" href="part0110_split_004.html#profane">profane</a>. A totem (an animal or plant believed to have symbolic significance), Durkheim argued, is a sacred object, regarded with veneration and surrounded by ritual activities. These ceremonies and rituals, in Durkheim’s view, are essential to unifying the members of groups.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Durkheim’s theory of religion is a good example of the functionalist tradition. To analyze the function of a social behavior or social institution such as religion is to study its contribution to the continuation of a group, community, or society. According to Durkheim, religion promotes a stable society by ensuring that people meet regularly to affirm common beliefs and values.</p>

<section id="weber-world-religions-and-social-change">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Weber: World Religions and Social Change</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Whereas Durkheim based his arguments on a restricted range of examples, Max Weber conducted a massive study of religions worldwide. No scholar before or since has undertaken a task of the scope Weber attempted. His writings on religion differ from those of Durkheim because they concentrate on the connection between religion and social change, and they contrast with those of Marx because Weber argued that religion was not necessarily a conservative force; on the contrary, religiously inspired movements have often produced dramatic social transformations. Thus, Protestantism, particularly Puritanism, according to Weber, was the source of the capitalist outlook found in the modern West. The early entrepreneurs were mostly Calvinists. Their drive to succeed, which helped initiate Western economic development, was originally prompted <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_663" title="663"></span>by a desire to serve God. Material success was considered a sign of divine favor. But because Calvinists also believed that one should not ostentatiously flaunt one’s wealth, Calvinist entrepreneurs were likely to reinvest their wealth in their enterprises, rather than spend it on personal consumption. Such “worldly asceticism,” as Weber called it, resulted in capital accumulation—the hallmark of a successful capitalist system.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">Max Weber categorized Eastern religions as “otherworldly” and Christianity as a “salvation religion.” Weber believed that Hinduism stressed escaping material existence to a higher plane of being, which cultivated an attitude of passivity. In contrast, he argued that Christianity and its emphasis on salvation could stimulate revolt against the existing order.</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Weber’s discussion of the effect of Protestantism on the development of the West was connected to a comprehensive attempt to understand the influence of religion on social and economic life in various cultures. After analyzing the Eastern religions, Weber concluded that they prevented the widespread development of industrial capitalism because they were oriented toward different values, such as escape from the toils of the material world. In traditional India and China, Weber held, periodic development of commerce, manufacturing, and urbanism did not generate the radical patterns of social change that led to industrial capitalism in the West. In his view, Indian and Chinese belief systems significantly inhibited such change. Hinduism in India, he argued, sees material reality as a veil hiding the true spiritual concerns to which humankind should be oriented; one should focus on spiritual development rather than the material world.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In China, according to Weber, Confucianism also directs activity away from economic “progress” because it emphasizes harmony with the world rather than promoting an active mastery of it. Although China was long the most powerful and most culturally developed civilization in the world, its dominant religious values acted as a brake on a stronger commitment to economic development. It is interesting to note that a century later, sociologists have attributed the current economic growth of China and other East Asian countries, at least in part, to the same set of beliefs that Weber saw as a deterrent, drawing parallels between certain aspects of Confucianism and the Protestant ethic (Tu, 1989; Berger, 1988).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Weber regarded Christianity as a <i class="italic">salvation religion</i>—one in which human beings can be “saved” if they accept the beliefs of the religion and follow its moral tenets. The notions of sin and of being rescued from sinfulness by God’s grace generate an emotional dynamism absent from the Eastern religions. Whereas Eastern religions cultivate an attitude of passivity or acceptance, Christianity demands a constant struggle against sin and thereby can stimulate revolt against the existing order. Religious leaders—such as Luther or Calvin—have arisen who reinterpret doctrines in such a way as to challenge the existing power structure.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_4">Critical Assessment of the Classical View</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Marx, Durkheim, and Weber each identified some important general characteristics of religions, and, in some ways, their views complement one another. Marx was right to claim that religion often has ideological implications, serving to justify the interests of ruling groups at the expense of others. There are innumerable examples in history. Consider the European missionaries who sought to convert “heathen” peoples to Christian beliefs; their motivations may have been sincere, yet their teachings reinforced the destruction of traditional cultures and the imposition of White domination. Also, almost all Christian denominations tolerated or endorsed slavery in the United States and other parts of the world into the nineteenth century. Doctrines were developed proclaiming slavery to be based on divine law, with disobedient slaves being considered guilty of an offense against God as well as their masters (Stampp, 1956).</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_664" title="664"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">But Weber was also correct in stressing the unsettling and often revolutionary effect of religious ideals on the established social order. In spite of the churches’ early support for slavery in the United States, church leaders later played a key role in fighting to abolish the institution. Religious beliefs have at times prompted social movements against unjust systems of authority. Religious sentiments were prominent in the civil rights movements of the 1960s, where Black churches played the key role. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a Baptist minister, was a cofounder of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization of Southern Black churches dedicated to ending racial segregation through nonviolent protests (Branch, 1989, 1999, 2007).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The divisive influences of religion find little mention in Durkheim’s work, which emphasized the role of religion in promoting social cohesion. Yet it is not difficult to redirect his ideas toward explaining religious division, conflict, and change, as well as solidarity. After all, much of the strength of feeling generated against other religious groups derives from the commitment to religious values that binds each community of believers. Among the most valuable points of Durkheim’s writings is his emphasis on ritual and ceremony. All religions hold regular assemblies of believers, at which ritual prescriptions are observed. As Durkheim rightly points out, ritual activities also mark the major transitions of life—birth, entry to adulthood, marriage, and death (van Gennep, 1977; orig. 1908).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Marx, Durkheim, and Weber based their theories of religion on their studies of societies in which a single religion predominated. Consequently, it seemed reasonable to examine the relationship between a predominant religion and the society as a whole. However, since the 1950s, some U.S. sociologists have challenged this classical view. Living in a society that is highly tolerant of religious diversity, contemporary theorists have focused on religious pluralism rather than on religious domination. Not surprisingly, their conclusions differ substantially from the views of Marx, Durkheim, and Weber, each of whom regarded religion as closely bound with the larger society. Religion was believed to reflect and reinforce society’s values, or at least the values of those who are most powerful; provide solidarity and social stability; and serve as an engine of social change. According to this view, religion is threatened by <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-secular-thinking" href="part0110_split_004.html#secular-thinking">secular thinking</a>, particularly as seen in the rise of science, technology, and rational thought.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Secularization, as we have noted previously, involves a decrease in religious belief and involvement, and therefore results in a weakening of the social and political power of religious organizations. Peter Berger (1967) has described religion in premodern societies as a “sacred canopy” that covers all aspects of life and is seldom questioned. In modern society, however, the sacred canopy is more like a quilt, a patchwork of different religious and secular belief systems. When beliefs are compared, it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain the idea that there is any single true faith.</p>
