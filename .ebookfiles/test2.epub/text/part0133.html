<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">discrimination:</b> Behavior that denies to the members of a particular group resources or rewards that can be obtained by others. Discrimination must be distinguished from <b class="bold1">prejudice</b>: Individuals who are prejudiced against others may not engage in discriminatory practices against them; conversely, people may act in a discriminatory fashion toward a group even though they are not prejudiced against that group.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">disengagement theory:</b> A functionalist theory of <b class="bold1">aging</b> that holds that it is functional for <b class="bold1">society</b> to remove people from their traditional <b class="bold1">roles</b> when they become retirement age, thereby freeing up those roles for others.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">economy:</b> The system of production and exchange that provides for the material needs of individuals living in a given <b class="bold1">society</b>. Economic institutions are of key importance in all social orders. What goes on in the economy usually influences other areas of social life.

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">egocentric:</b> According to Jean Piaget, the characteristic quality of a child during the early years of his or her life. Egocentric thinking involves understanding objects and events in the environment solely in terms of one’s own position.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">epidemiology:</b> The study of the distribution and incidence of disease and illness within a <b class="bold1">population</b>.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">ethnic cleansing:</b> The creation of ethnically homogeneous territories through the mass expulsion of other ethnic <b class="bold1">populations</b>.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">ethnicity:</b> Cultural <b class="bold1">values</b> and <b class="bold1">norms</b> that distinguish the members of a given group from others.
