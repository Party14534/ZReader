<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">InQuizitive</b></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">InQuizitive—Norton’s adaptive learning platform—delivers a personalized sequence of questions to each student and provides answer-specific feedback in an engaging, game-like environment. With each activity organized around the chapters’ signature four-part structure, the revised InQuizitive course for the Twelfth Seagull Edition of <i class="italic">Introduction to Sociology</i> includes interactive questions on the new “Applying Sociology” tables as well as new questions that ask students to recall and apply theoretical concepts introduced in <a href="part0009_split_000.html#8IL20-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 1</a>. Each InQuizitive activity has been streamlined so that there are no more than 50 questions per chapter.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">“Writing for Sociology” online tutorials</b></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These tutorials strengthen essential skills such as evaluating sources, developing research questions, choosing a research method, and crafting an effective introductory paragraph. Each tutorial includes concept check questions as well as short answer prompts that can serve as a springboard for papers. Students receive full credit for completing each tutorial, and instructors can review their answers within the Norton gradebook, adjusting grades if they choose. The tutorials offer students low-stakes opportunities to strengthen their writing skills before they start working on a writing assignment.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">(New) Everyday Sociology Blog Online Quizzes</b></p>

These chapter-based 2–3 question quizzes give instructors a low-stakes but structured way to bring current events into the classroom.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Ebooks</b></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Norton Ebooks give students and instructors an enhanced reading experience at a fraction of the cost of a print textbook.
