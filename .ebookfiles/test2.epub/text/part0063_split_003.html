<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">What About Inequality Within Countries?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we noted earlier in this chapter, export-oriented industrialization—the relocation of industrial manufacturing from high-wage to lower-wage countries—has enabled some of the latter to industrialize, resulting in their economic growth. This “rise of the rest” (Zakaria, 2009) has lowered the economic gap between high-income and middle-income countries, reducing global inequality, at least among those middle-income countries that have been able to benefit from these changes. This process began with Japan in the 1950s, but it quickly extended to what were called the newly industrializing economies (NIEs) in East Asia. Today, the more widely used term is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-emerging-economies" href="part0063_split_005.html#emerging-economies">emerging economies</a>, or the rapidly growing economies of the world, particularly in East Asia but also in Latin America. The East Asian emerging economies included Hong Kong in the 1960s and Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan in the 1970s and 1980s. Other Asian countries followed in the 1980s and the early 1990s, most notably China, but also Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Today, most of these countries are in the middle-income category, and some—such as Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan—have reached the high-income category.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">China, the world’s most populous country, has one of the most rapidly growing economies on the planet. At an average annual compound growth rate of 12 percent between 1980 and 2010 (World Bank, 2019d), the Chinese economy more than doubled, and is today the world’s second-largest economy behind the United States, having surpassed Japan in 2010. Although China’s rate of growth has slowed in the last few years (and plummeted in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), it remains the premier example of how export-oriented industrialization can reduce inequality between wealthy and once-poor nations.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Within countries, however, the story is somewhat different. Among high-income countries, inequality generally declined during much of the twentieth century, as policies were adopted (such as progressive income taxes, retirement systems, health care, and social welfare programs) that enabled a growing number of citizens to enjoy the fruits of expanding economies. But beginning in the 1970s, when the globalization of manufacturing began to take off, inequality once again began to increase in high-income countries.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One measure, the share of total national income going to the richest 1 percent of the population, suggests that at least in the United States, the level of inequality, which declined until the 1960s, has returned to what it was a century ago (Roser and Ortiz-Ospina, 2017). In 1913, the top 1 percent of U.S. households accounted for 18 percent of total U.S. income. By the 1960s, that share had dropped by more than half, to only about 9 percent; today, it has rebounded to higher levels than a century ago (22 percent in 2015). The pattern in the share going to the top tenth of 1 percent (the superrich) has been even more dramatic: It dropped from nearly 9 percent to 2 percent by the 1970s, but by 2018 it had grown to 11 percent, more than a five-fold increase (Saez, 2016; Inequality.org, 2020).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">Inequality within some high-income countries has followed a U-shaped pattern over the past century, declining sharply until the 1960s and 1970s, then increasing, partly as a result of globalization. But other factors, such as national economic policies, are also important. Contrast the United States with European countries such as France and the Netherlands, as well as Japan, where national policies have muted the impact of globalization.</i></p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although the growth of inequality in the United States is extreme among high-income countries, Britain and Canada have experienced similar patterns (Figure 9.3). In Europe, the pattern is different: While there has been a slight uptick in inequality <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_317" title="317"></span>since the 1970s, levels of inequality do not approach what they were a century ago. There are many reasons for this pattern, one of which is that the United States, Britain, and even Canada have pursued economic policies that are far more neoliberal than most European countries. As a result, the impact of globalization has been more severe.</p>
