<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the previous sections, we learned that the purpose and function of schooling have been viewed from a variety of perspectives. On the one hand, education has consistently been seen as a means of equalization. Access to universal education, it has been argued, could help reduce disparities in wealth and power. On the other hand, some theorists have argued that schools serve to perpetuate, or reproduce, inequalities. Are educational opportunities equal for everyone? Has education in fact proven to be a great equalizer?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There is a vast amount of research that examines these questions. Next, we outline some of the important research related to educational equality and differential outcomes (when one group consistently outperforms another group in terms of educational achievement). The concepts offered here help to frame recent debates surrounding education in the United States. We also report on recent studies that help us understand the development and proliferation of the Internet, and “digital gaps,” or disparities in its access and use.</p>
