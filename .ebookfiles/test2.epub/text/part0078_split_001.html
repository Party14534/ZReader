<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The United States and other industrial societies are said to be <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-graying" href="part0078_split_003.html#graying">graying</a>—that is, experiencing an increase in the proportion of the population classified as <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-older-adults" href="part0078_split_003.html#older-adults">older adults</a>. Older adults are generally considered to be persons ages 65 and older, although, as we will see later in this chapter, aging is a multifaceted process. Graying is the result of two long-term trends in industrial societies: the tendency of families to have fewer children (discussed in <a href="part0096_split_000.html#2RHM00-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 15</a>) and the fact that people are living longer.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For most of human history, the average life expectancy at birth was less than 20 years; the main reason was that many people died in infancy or during early childhood. As such, the “average” age at which a person died was very low. About 2,000 years ago, the average newborn baby in Rome could expect to live to just age 22. In 1900 in the United States, the average baby boy could expect to live to about age 46 and the average baby girl to about 48. Today, by contrast, the average baby boy born in the United States has a life expectancy of 76.2 years, while life expectancy for the average baby girl is 81.2 years (Figure 12.1) (World <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_421" title="421"></span>Bank, 2019l). However, there is enormous variation in life expectancy depending on where a baby is born—from 84 years in Japan to 53 years in Sierra Leone (World Health Organization, 2018). Even within the United States, life expectancy varies widely; a Black baby boy born today can expect to live until about 71, whereas a White baby girl will live an average of 10 years longer—until age 81 (Kochanek et al., 2020).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What explains the aging of the United States and other societies? Modern agriculture, sanitation systems, epidemic control, improved nutrition, and medicine have all contributed to a decline in mortality and an increase in life expectancy throughout the world. In most societies today, fewer children die in infancy and more adults survive until their seventies, eighties, and even older. The U.S. population, like that of other industrial societies, is aging even faster than that of less industrialized nations. The number of older adults in the United States is expected to nearly double, from 52 million in 2018 to more than 95 million by 2060 (Mather et al., 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Given the growing numbers of older adults and the declining numbers of younger persons, the median age of the population is rising. In 1850, half the U.S. population was older than 19. Today, half is over 38; by 2050, half will be over 42 (Figure 12.2). These trends have enormous importance for the future of U.S. society. In a culture that often worships eternal youth, what will happen when a quarter of the population is over 65?</p>
