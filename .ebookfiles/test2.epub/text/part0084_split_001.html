<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Democracy</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The terms <i class="italic">freedom</i> and <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-democracy" href="part0084_split_003.html#democracy">democracy</a> are sometimes used interchangeably, since the latter is intended to guarantee the former. The word democracy has its roots in the Greek term <i class="italic">demokratia</i>, from <i class="italic">demos</i> (people) and <i class="italic">kratos</i> (rule). It refers to a political system in which the people rule. But what does it mean to be “ruled by the people”? Many questions can be raised about this seemingly obvious phrase (Held, 2006).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Regarding the “people,” who exactly are they? Everyone? Only people who are affected by the decisions? What should be the proper voting age? What about people who are currently in jail or once were? What about people who are not citizens but who have lived in the country for years and have a strong stake in any decisions that might affect them? What if there are strong differences of opinion among “the people”—how are the rights of the minority protected? What about people who choose not to participate or who find it difficult to participate, because of work or family obligations or lack of understanding of complex issues?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Regarding “rule,” how, exactly, is it exercised? By periodic voting? Actual participation in all decisions that might affect one’s life? Does “rule” refer only to government decisions or to other spheres of life as well, such as the economy? Does it encompass the daily administrative decisions of governments, or should it refer only to major policy decisions? Are all rules equally binding? Should rule-breaking be punished, and, if so, how severely? How much (and what forms of) dissent should be tolerated? If some people believe that the rules are unjust, do they have the right to disobey them?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Answers to these questions have varied over time and in different societies. For example, during U.S. history, “the people” have been variously understood as owners of <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_456" title="456"></span>property, White men, educated men, men, and adult men and women. In some societies, democracy is limited to the political sphere; in others, it extends to other areas of social life. Moreover, in modern societies, it is not really feasible to have everybody “rule.” This reality has led to at least two different forms of democracy: participatory democracy and liberal democracy.</p>
<section id="participatory-democracy-section">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Participatory Democracy</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-participatory-democracy" href="part0084_split_003.html#participatory-democracy">Participatory democracy</a> exists when decisions are made communally by those affected by them. This was the original type of democracy practiced in ancient Athens, where the citizens, constituting a small minority of Athenian society (women and slaves were excluded), regularly assembled to consider policies and make major decisions. Participatory democracy has limited importance in modern societies, where the mass of the population has political rights, rendering it impossible for everyone to participate actively in the making of all the decisions that affect them.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">Many states have held referenda, a form of participatory democracy whereby the entire electorate votes on a particular proposal, on hot-button issues such as marijuana legalization and the death penalty.</figcaption>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In modern societies, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-direct-democracy" href="part0084_split_003.html#direct-democracy">direct democracy</a> is a much more realistic approach to engaging citizens in decisions. A direct democracy is a form of participatory democracy in which citizens vote directly on laws and policies; however, they do not need to convene in one setting to do so. For example, Americans can visit voting booths in their hometowns to vote directly on legislation that affects their lives.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet some facets of participatory democracy do play a part in modern societies. Some New England towns still hold annual town hall meetings that are a form of participatory democracy. The holding of a referendum, whereby the majority expresses its views on a particular issue, is another form of participatory democracy. Direct consultation of large numbers of people is made possible by simplifying the issue to one or two questions to be answered. Referenda are employed frequently on a state level in the United States to decide controversial issues, such as the legalization of marijuana.</p>

<section id="monarchies-and-liberal-democracies">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Monarchies and Liberal Democracies</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Not all countries today claim to be democratic. In a handful of countries (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and some small Middle Eastern emirates), <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-monarchies" href="part0084_split_003.html#monarchies">monarchies</a> (rule by unelected kings or queens) still exist. While this was a common form of government well into the nineteenth century, true monarchies <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_457" title="457"></span>are rare today. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-constitutional-monarchs" href="part0084_split_003.html#constitutional-monarchs">Constitutional monarchs</a> are still found (the queen of England, the king of Sweden, the emperor of Japan), but they are monarchs in name only. Their actual power is severely restricted by their respective countries’ constitutions, which vest authority in the elected representatives of the people.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Countries in which voters can choose between two or more political parties and in which the majority of the adult population has the right to vote are usually called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-liberal-democracies" href="part0084_split_003.html#liberal-democracies">liberal democracies</a>. The United States, the Western European countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand all fall into this category. Some developing countries, such as India, also have liberal democratic systems.</p>

<section id="populist-authoritarianism">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Populist Authoritarianism</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In recent years, there has been a turn toward what has been described as “populist authoritarianism” in many countries, including European countries and the United States. Populist authoritarianism is both a philosophy and a style of governance characterized by assertive leadership that values security over civil liberties. It is typically coupled with a strong nationalism that is anti-immigrant and—in its current form—strongly anti-globalization. As the term suggests, it combines two ideas: <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-populism" href="part0084_split_003.html#populism">populism</a> (the belief in “popular sovereignty and direct democracy at any cost, if necessary overriding minority rights, elite expertise, constitutional checks-and-balances, conventional practices, and decision-making by elected representatives . . . [in which leaders] maintain direct links with their followers, through public rallies, television studios, and social media”) and <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-authoritarianism" href="part0084_split_003.html#authoritarianism">authoritarianism</a> (“policy positions which endorse the values of tough security against threats from outsiders, xenophobic nationalism, strict adherence to conventional moral norms, and intolerance of multiculturalism”). Populist authoritarianism can become a challenge to liberal democracy (Norris and Inglehart, 2018).</p>
