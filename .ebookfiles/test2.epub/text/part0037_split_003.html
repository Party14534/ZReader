<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">The Macro-Micro Link: Anderson’s <i class="italic1">Streetwise</i></h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In his book <i class="italic">Streetwise: Race, Class, and Change in an Urban Community</i> (1990), Elijah Anderson describes social interaction on the streets of two adjacent urban neighborhoods, noting that studying everyday life sheds light on how the individual building blocks of infinite micro-level interactions create social order. He is particularly interested in understanding interactions when at least one party was viewed as threatening. Anderson shows that the manner in which many Blacks and Whites interact on the streets of a northern city in the United States has a great deal to do with the structure of racial stereotypes, which itself is linked to the economic structure of society. In this way, he reveals the link between micro interactions and the larger macro structures of society.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_155" title="155"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Anderson begins by recalling Erving Goffman’s description of how social roles and statuses come into existence in particular contexts or locations:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When an individual enters the presence of others, they commonly seek to acquire information about him or bring into play information already possessed. . . . Information about the individual helps to define the situation, enabling others to know in advance what he will expect of them and they may expect of him. (Anderson, 1990)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Following Goffman’s lead, Anderson (1990) asked what types of behavioral cues and signs make up the vocabulary of public interaction. He concluded that skin color, gender, age, companions, clothing, jewelry, and the objects people carry help identify them, allowing assumptions to be formed and communication to occur. Movements (quick or slow, false or sincere, comprehensible or incomprehensible) further refine this public communication. Factors such as time of day or an activity that “explains” a person’s presence can also affect how and how quickly the image of “stranger” is neutralized. If a stranger cannot pass inspection and be assessed as “safe,” the image of predator may arise, and fellow pedestrians may try to maintain a distance consistent with that image.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to Anderson, the people most likely to pass inspection are those who do not fall into commonly accepted stereotypes of dangerous persons: “Children readily pass inspection, while women and White men do so more slowly, Black women, Black men, and Black male teenagers most slowly of all.” In showing that interactional tensions derive from outside statuses such as race, class, and gender, Anderson makes clear that we cannot develop a full understanding of the situation by looking at the micro interactions themselves. This is how he makes the link between micro interactions and macro processes.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">Immediate assumptions based on race, gender, class, and style of dress, among other signs and behavioral cues, affect the way strangers interact. Elijah Anderson’s study of social interaction between strangers on urban streets showed a strong connection between such micro-level interactions and the creation of social order.</figcaption>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Anderson argues that people are streetwise when they develop skills such as “the art of avoidance” to deal with their felt vulnerability toward violence and crime. According to Anderson, Whites who are not streetwise do not recognize the difference between different kinds of Black men (e.g., middle-class youths versus gang members). They may also not know how to alter the number of paces to walk behind a suspicious person or how to bypass bad blocks at various times of day. In these ways, social science research can help you understand how a very ordinary behavior—navigating one’s way through the city streets—reveals important lessons about the nature of contemporary social interaction.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">The Cosmopolitan Canopy</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although public space can often be a site of tension and anxiety, the sociologist Elijah Anderson argues in <i class="italic">The Cosmopolitan Canopy</i> (2011) that social interaction in urban spaces is not all doom and gloom. There are many places where people of different backgrounds actually get along. For Anderson, the racially and ethnically diverse spaces he has studied offer “a respite from the lingering tensions of urban life as well as an opportunity for diverse peoples to come together.” They are what he calls “pluralistic spaces where people engage with one another in a spirit of civility, or even comity and goodwill.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">On the basis of in-depth observations of public areas in his long-time home of Philadelphia, Anderson reports on various important sites in the city. These include the Reading Terminal Market, Rittenhouse Square, and the Galleria Mall. The first two are venues dominated by middle- and upper-middle-class norms and values, while the Galleria caters to the tastes of the Black working classes and the poor. All three sites, however, are spaces in which various kinds of people meet, agree to lay down their swords, carry on their life routines, and, in many cases, enjoy themselves.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Anderson begins with an ode to Philadelphia’s indoor farmer’s market—the downtown Reading Terminal Market. A regular at the market for decades, he paints a loving portrait of the many types of people who congregate there, including the population of Amish vendors. The patrons range from corporate executives to construction workers to senior citizens in poor health. They are all “on their best behavior” as they eat and shop for food and other items.</p>
<figure class="figure--fullwidth" data-figure-id="ch05ph08"><a data-href="../images/Ch05ph08.jpg" tabindex="0" data-size="1250x1093"><img class="figure__image" alt="" src="../images/00060.jpeg" data-image-id="ch05ph08"/></a>
<figcaption class="figure__caption">Community pools are an example of what Elijah Anderson refers to as a cosmopolitan canopy, an area where diverse groups of people can come together and engage in a “spirit of civility.”</figcaption>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What is it about this space that causes people to “show a certain civility and even an openness to strangers”? To begin, the city is divided into two kinds of human beings: the open-minded people, whom he calls “cosmos” (shorthand for cosmopolitan), and the close-minded, whom he calls “ethnos” (shorthand for ethnocentric). As Anderson sees it, Reading Terminal Market is filled with open-minded people. Through a kind of people watching, each contributes to the creation of the cosmopolitan canopy. It is literally the sight of so many kinds of people in one another’s physical presence, as well as participation in what one sees, that reinforces the idea of a “neutral space.” Whites and minorities who have few opportunities for such interaction elsewhere can relax and move about with security. Blacks, however, understand that their status there is always provisional, meaning that at any moment, they are subject to dramatic situations in which Whites fail to treat them with the respect they deserve.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The dynamic that Anderson highlights over and over is the self-fulfilling nature of the interaction: The interaction and the sight of it makes it so. Most who come are probably repeat players, and they have long visualized different kinds of people getting along in the space. For newcomers, on the other hand, such visualization <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_157" title="157"></span>of tolerance is “infectious.” In the Rittenhouse Square Park and the streets surrounding it, other social cues serve to bring about similar results. There is, for example, a fountain and a statue of a goat that attract mothers, nannies, and children. The sight of “public mothering” is a cue that indicates this is a civil place. A sense of safety and protection underlies good behavior and, in turn, leads to a virtuous circle of other acts of good will. Dog walkers are also crucial, with interaction naturally occurring between them and others (including children) as they form a critical mass in the park throughout the day. In a similarly positive encounter, when an elderly White woman has trouble standing up, a man sitting on a nearby bench rises and offers his hand to help. As Anderson notes: “Those of us who observed this act realized that we ourselves might expect such help or be called upon to render it.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Galleria is a different story. Anderson describes it as the “ghetto downtown,” a community of close-minded poor Blacks (“ethnos”) in one mall. What makes it a canopy, albeit not a cosmopolitan one, is that various elements of the Black community—the “street” and the “decent”—can coexist here. People feel free to be themselves, “loud and boisterous and frank in their comments, released from the inhibitions they might feel among Whites.” The code of the street threatens to undermine the public order at any moment, but everyone is on their best behavior, with security guards reinforcing decorum. Nevertheless, Anderson stresses that through a negative feedback loop, this place has a self-reinforcing negative reputation among cosmopolitan Whites and Blacks. It arises from cues the non-White population on the streets around the mall give off and culminates in occasional deeply disturbing incidents such as the “flash mob”—high school students organized through Facebook and Twitter who suddenly appear on the downtown streets “wreaking havoc on businesses and terrifying pedestrians.” Anderson continues: “As quickly as this storm appears out of the blue, it is over, but the effects are lasting, powerfully redefining the public spaces of the canopy zone” (98).</p>
