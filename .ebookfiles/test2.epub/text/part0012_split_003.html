<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Conflict Theories</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Functionalism and symbolic interactionism are not the only modern theoretical traditions of importance in sociology. A third influential approach is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-conflict-theory" href="part0012_split_007.html#conflict-theory">conflict theory</a>. In general, conflict theories underscore the role of coercion and power in producing social order. Social order is believed to be maintained by domination, with power in the hands of those who possess the greatest political, economic, and social resources; historically, those with power would include White men with ample economic and political resources. Two particular approaches typically classified under the broad heading of conflict theories are Marxism and feminist theories.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Marxism</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Marxists, of course, all trace their views back to the writings of Karl Marx, but today, some schools of Marxist thought take very different theoretical positions.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In all its variations, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-marxism" href="part0012_split_007.html#marxism">Marxism</a> differs from non-Marxist traditions of sociology in that its adherents view sociology as a <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_22" title="22"></span>combination of sociological analysis and political reform. Marxism is supposed to generate a program of radical political change. Moreover, Marxists lay more emphasis on conflict, class divisions, power, and ideology than do many non-Marxist sociologists, especially those influenced by functionalism. The concept of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-power" href="part0012_split_007.html#power">power</a> is of great importance to Marxist sociologists and to sociology in general. Power refers to the ability of individuals or groups to make their own interests count, even when others resist. Power sometimes involves the direct use of force but is almost always accompanied by the development of ideas (<a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-ideologies" href="part0012_split_007.html#ideologies">ideologies</a>), which are used to justify the actions of the powerful. Power, ideology, and conflict are always closely connected. Many conflicts are about power because of the rewards it can bring. Those who hold the most power may depend on the influence of ideology to retain their dominance, but they are usually also able to use force if necessary.</p>

<section id="feminism-and-feminist-theory">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Feminism and Feminist Theory</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-feminist-theory" href="part0012_split_007.html#feminist-theory">Feminist theory</a> is one of the most prominent areas of contemporary sociology. This development is notable because gender issues are scarcely touched upon in the work of the major figures who established the discipline. The success of feminism’s entry into sociology required a fundamental shift in the discipline’s approach.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many feminist theorists’ experiences in the women’s movement of the 1960s and 1970s influenced their work as sociologists. Like Marxism, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-feminism" href="part0012_split_007.html#feminism">feminism</a> links sociological theory and political reform. Many feminist sociologists have been advocates for political and social action to eliminate the inequalities between women and men in both the public and the private spheres.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Feminist sociologists argue that women’s lives and experiences are central to the study of society. Historically, sociology, like most academic disciplines, has presumed a male point of view. Concerned with women’s subordination in society, feminist sociologists highlight gender relations and gender inequality as important determinants of social life in terms of both social interaction and social institutions such as the family, the workplace, and the educational system. Feminist theory emphasizes that gendered patterns and gendered inequalities are not natural but socially constructed. (We will cover this point in more detail in <a href="part0065_split_000.html#1TVKI0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 10</a>.)</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, feminist sociology focuses on the intersection of gender, race, and class. A feminist approach to the study of inequality <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_23" title="23"></span>has influenced new fields of study, such as men’s studies, sexuality studies, and LGBTQ studies. Taken together, these theoretical perspectives underscore power imbalances and draw attention to the ways that social change must entail shifts in the balance of power—consistent with the overarching themes of conflict theories.</p>
