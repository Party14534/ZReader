<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Achievement Gap: Components, Patterns, and Explanations</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the core concepts in the sociology of education is the notion of educational inequalities, or <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-achievement-gap" href="part0103_split_003.html#achievement-gap">achievement gap</a> among different groups of students. This gap refers to the fact that certain groups, such as poor or working-class students, and certain minority groups, tend to receive lower scores on standardized tests and other measures of academic success (e.g., high school graduation rates and college admission rates) than do their more privileged counterparts. Sociologists have sought to explain achievement gaps in a variety of ways and have highlighted the importance of influences such as social background—particularly the educational and economic resources of one’s parents—as well as intelligence.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologist Sean Reardon has done extensive research on the achievement gap, identifying its sources and how it has changed over time. Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, the achievement gap between the richest and poorest children—those living in households in the 10th and 90th percentile of income distribution, respectively—increased dramatically. For children born in 2001, the class-based achievement gap is 30 to 40 percent greater than it was for children born in the 1970s. Today, the gap between rich and poor students is nearly twice as large as the well-documented achievement gap between Black and White ones (Reardon, 2011, 2012).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Four explanations have been offered for the stark and growing socioeconomic gap in achievement (Reardon, 2012). First, middle- and upper-middle-class parents tend to invest more heavily in their children’s cognitive development (by reading stories, playing word games, and consciously engaging them in activities explicitly related to intellectual development) than in their health, nutrition, or safety. Sociologist Julia Wrigley’s analysis of parenting magazine articles throughout the twentieth century found that in recent decades, children’s cognitive development has become a major concern of middle-class parents, who see success in school as essential to a successful career (Wrigley, 1989). Second, income inequality has increased sharply throughout the late twentieth century, as we learned in <a href="part0053_split_000.html#1IHDQ0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 8</a>. Reardon (2012) argues that those with greater income can buy the goods and services needed to help their child thrive in school. The benefits accrued to the “haves” versus “have-nots” have <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_617" title="617"></span>thus escalated considerably. Third, income is related to a range of other social resources that enable parents to support their children’s intellectual development. Parents with education possess the specific skills and knowledge needed to help their children’s performance in school. Income, too, is related to family structure, as we saw in <a href="part0096_split_000.html#2RHM00-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 15</a>. Co-residential married parents may have more time to engage children in activities such as reading or writing (Reardon, 2012). Finally, residential segregation on the basis of income rose throughout the late twentieth century. Today’s wealthier families can afford homes in safer neighborhoods with higher-quality schools and more enrichment activities. As we shall see later in this chapter, neighborhoods and schools have the power to shape what, how, and how successfully children learn.</p>
