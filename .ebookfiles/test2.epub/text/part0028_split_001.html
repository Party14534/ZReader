<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When you think about the kind of parent you might someday be, what values do you hope to instill in your children? Would you like them to be successful? Creative? Well-mannered? Kind? Obedient? Religious? In 2014, the Pew Research Center asked more than 3,000 parents in the United States to indicate which of 12 qualities they believed were “most important” to instill in their children. “Being responsible” ranked first, followed closely by “hard work” and “helping others” (Parker, 2014). “Creativity” was in the middle of the pack, while “religious faith” rated second to last.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These data show that American parents hold nearly universal beliefs that children should be kind, responsible, productive members of society; more than 90 percent of those polled ranked responsibility and hard work as “important,” and 86 percent each rated “helping others” and “being well-mannered” as very important. Think about the ways that your parents, schoolteachers, siblings, friends, and even your boss at your most recent job instilled such values in you. Whether lecturing you on “being responsible,” serving as a positive role model, or praising you for a job well done, these efforts are examples of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-socialization" href="part0028_split_002.html#socialization">socialization</a>, or the lifelong process of learning the norms, values, behavior, and social skills appropriate to your social position, such as your age, gender, or social class.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Try to recall the lessons you learned on your first day of kindergarten. These are likely very different from the messages you received at your college orientation session when you first arrived on campus. A core aspect of socialization is that the lessons one learns must be appropriate to one’s level of maturity. For example, the Pew study found that parents of teenagers are more likely than parents of younger children to emphasize independence and good manners, while parents of young children are slightly more likely to rate a child’s creativity as highly important.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The lessons that parents deem essential for their children also vary over historical time. In the classic <i class="italic">Middletown</i> studies, a sociological examination of everyday life in the quintessentially “middle American” city of Muncie, Indiana, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_99" title="99"></span>in the early 1920s, researchers asked parents what traits they valued in their children. The most commonly named trait was “obedience” (Lynd and Lynd, 1929). When residents of Muncie were interviewed again, more than 50 years later, however, the value of “obedience” was barely uttered, giving way to “autonomy” and “independence” (Alwin, 1988).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These changes reflect larger shifts in the roles and opportunities facing young people; in earlier historical periods when most children would grow up to work in factories or farms, obedience would be a valued and useful trait on the job. By the late twentieth century, however, when children would grow up to become white-collar professionals, their career prospects would depend on their capacity for independent thinking and creativity. In this way, socialization reflects not only the social position that a child has, but the positions that a child will someday occupy.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The examples just cited illustrate the important sociological concept of socialization, or the ways we learn to become human. Socialization is the process whereby an infant gradually becomes a self-aware, knowledgeable person, skilled in the ways of his or her culture and historical time period. It also describes the processes whereby preschool-age children learn to be students, students learn to be workers, and childless persons learn to become parents. Most social roles we hold in life seem “natural” but actually involve intense socialization, or learning how to successfully navigate one’s roles and relationships throughout the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-life-course" href="part0028_split_002.html#life-course">life course</a>.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Socialization is a key mechanism contributing to <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-reproduction" href="part0028_split_002.html#social-reproduction">social reproduction</a>—the process whereby societies have structural continuity over time. During socialization, especially in the early years, children learn the ways of their elders, thereby perpetuating their values, norms, and social practices across the generations. All societies have characteristics that endure over time, even though their members change as individuals are born and die. North American society, for example, has many distinctive social and cultural characteristics that have persisted for generations—such as the fact that English is the main language spoken.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Socialization connects different generations to one another (Turnbull, 1983). The birth of a child alters the lives of those who are responsible for the child’s upbringing—who themselves undergo new learning experiences. Older people, while of course remaining parents, forge a new set of relationships with another generation when they become grandparents. Although cultural learning is much more intense in infancy and early childhood than later in life, learning and adjustment continue through the life course.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the sections to follow, we continue the theme of nature interacting with nurture introduced in the previous chapter. We first explore the main agents of socialization—families, schools, peers, and the media—considering how socialization contributes to social reproduction. We then analyze human development from infancy to early <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_100" title="100"></span>childhood, identifying the main stages of change. Different writers have offered a number of theoretical interpretations of how and why children develop as they do, and we describe and compare these, including theories that explain how people develop gender identities. We introduce recent research on the process of race socialization, exploring the ways that parents teach children about the meaning of racial identity. To conclude the chapter, we consider questions surrounding the influence of social factors on gender learning, as well as the issue of bullying and what we can do about it.</p>
