<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">What Will the Economy of the Future Look Like?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we have seen, there has been significant job loss in manufacturing, with a corresponding growth in service-sector jobs. Unlike the jobs that have been lost in manufacturing, service-sector jobs tend to be nonunionized and low-wage. Some observers suggest that what is occurring today is a transition to a new type of society no longer based primarily on manufacturing or low-paying service work. We are entering, they claim, a phase of development beyond the industrial era altogether. A variety of terms have been coined to describe this new social order, such as the <i class="italic">postindustrial society</i>, the <i class="italic">information age</i>, and the <i class="italic">“new” economy.</i> The term that has come into most common usage, however, is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-knowledge-economy" href="part0094_split_004.html#knowledge-economy">knowledge economy</a>.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A precise definition of the knowledge economy is difficult to formulate, but in general, it refers to an economy in which ideas, information, and forms of knowledge underpin innovation and economic growth. In a knowledge economy, much of the workforce is involved in research and development; advanced technologies; and the design, marketing, sales, and service of innovative products, rather than in their physical production. Employees in this economy can be termed “knowledge workers.” The knowledge economy is dominated <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_554" title="554"></span>by the constant flow of information and opinions and by the powerful potential of science and technology.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">How widespread is the knowledge economy at the start of the twenty-first century? The World Bank (2012) created a Knowledge Economy Index (KEI), which rates countries based on their overall preparedness to compete in the knowledge economy. Knowledge-based industries are understood broadly to include high technology, education and training, research and development, and the financial and investment sector. Knowledge-economy jobs are typically said to include scientists and engineers engaged in innovative research and development, and research scholars more generally; highly skilled occupations that involve the use of advanced technology; financial management and services; and, in general, any occupation or profession that requires the ability to think symbolically and analytically (and that typically involves higher education and specialized skills) (Castells, 2000).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The current, expanded version of the KEI (see, for example, Pospisil et al., 2019) uses four “pillars” to gauge a country’s knowledge-economy performance. To rank high on the index, a country must have</p>
<ol class="fmnl">
<li class="bcpt" value="1">A high degree of educational attainment at the secondary, college, and technical levels, providing the skills needed for innovation;</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="2">Access to advanced communications, including widely accessible broadband networks;</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="3">Scientific accomplishments, as measured by high levels of spending on research and development, publications in scientific journals, and number and quality of patents; and</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="4">An open political and economic environment, including adherence to the rule of law, an effective regulatory environment; and openness to free trade with other countries.</li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Based on these measures, one study (Ojanperä, Graham, and Zook, 2019), using 2012 data, ranked the Scandinavian nations (Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Norway) at the top of list, since they score high on all these measures. The United States is not far behind. China, on the other hand—partly because it lacks the open political and economic environment that makes up one of the four “pillars” of the index—ranks far behind, roughly in the same category as Russia, Mexico, and much of Latin America.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While no one can deny that innovation is an important driver of economic competitiveness, nor that knowledge is a key component of innovation, it is not clear that all four “pillars” of the knowledge economy must be satisfied for a country to succeed economically.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">China, for example, ranks poorly on the KEI index—yet has rapidly advanced technologically over the past decade, to the point where in a number of areas it appears to be rivalling the United States. One study of 17.2 million scientific papers in the hottest technology fields, published between 2013 and 2018, found that China dominated 23 of the 30 fields (the United States dominated the remaining seven). Some key fields where China had the largest number of scientific papers included batteries (examples: organic thin-film solar and lithium-ion batteries); semiconductors; new and advanced materials (examples: photocatalysts and carbon quantum dots); and biotech (examples: nucleic acid-targeted cancer treatment). China tripled its spending on research <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_555" title="555"></span>and development between 2010 and 2016, and currently spends as much as the United States (Okoshi, 2019). China now leads the world in the sheer volume of Internet retail transactions; a Chinese company, Huawei, is globally dominant in the development and sales of 5G Internet equipment; and China’s space program has landed a vehicle on the far side of the moon.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Chinese government has played a key role in these achievements. In 2006, it developed a 15-year national science and technology plan intended to end China’s reliance on other countries for advanced technologies. The plan identified key areas for large-scale public investment, in the belief that the state should play a key role—alongside the market—in determining (and funding) which areas would drive innovation. Other 5- and 15-year plans have followed. This state-centered approach to development runs counter to the more market-driven approach championed by the United States and other advanced industrial countries and reflected in the KEI measures that give China poor marks despite the country’s obvious achievements. (It should be noted that China’s success is not only due to state development plans and public investment in key fields; China has also derived some of its technological gains by requiring foreign firms that operate in China to share their technology, as well as by outright technological theft; see Appelbaum et al., 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">China is offering the world another model, and it remains an open question whether or not it will succeed in its efforts to create a knowledge economy in which the government plays a key role at all levels. Will China’s heavy-handed state-led approach encourage knowledge economy innovation—or stifle it?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What does this portend for the United States? No one can say for sure, but it seems unlikely that the American nonfarm workforce—which in July 2019 included more than 164 million employed people, along with another 6.1 million people (3.7 percent of the labor force) looking for work (BLS, 2019h)—will all somehow become knowledge-economy workers. Will current economic changes produce another period of sustained economic growth, in which workers at all levels become a scarcity, with wages and salaries steadily rising, as they did in the post–World War II period? Or will the American workforce increasingly be split into two categories: those with the educational background, skills, and good fortune to thrive as knowledge workers, and everyone else, who may find themselves chasing after a dwindling number of manufacturing jobs and lower-paying service work?</p>
