<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Do New Immigrants Help or Hinder the Nation’s Economy?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The cultural and social landscape of the United States is viewed as an amalgam of diverse cultures, largely because of our nation’s history as a refuge for immigrants. Today, however, policy makers and social scientists disagree over the social and economic costs of immigration.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Before discussing this debate, it is important to understand the current state of immigration to the United States. There are more than 44.4 million foreign-born individuals in the United States, comprising 13.6 percent of the total population (Radford, 2019). This represents a fourfold increase since 1960, when there were 9.7 million immigrants in the United States (Brown and Stepler, 2016). Each year about a million immigrants enter the United States (Lopez and Bialik, 2017). In contrast to the major wave of immigration in the 1880s and 1890s, just 12 percent of immigrants admitted into the United States since 1965 were of European origin. In fact, 51 percent have come from Latin America, including 25 percent from Mexico, and another 27 percent have come from South/East Asia (Radford, 2019). This change is attributed to two government acts: the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments, which abolished preference for northern and western European immigrants and gave preference to “family reunification”—rather than occupational skills—as a reason for accepting immigrants; and the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which provided amnesty for many illegal immigrants. Since 2010, more Asian immigrants have come to the United States than Hispanic immigrants (Brown and Stepler, 2016). Immigration from Mexico <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_403" title="403"></span>has dropped precipitously in recent years, from 369,000 immigrants in 2005 to just 124,000 in 2017 (Migration Policy Institute, 2017; Radford, 2019).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Much of the debate focuses on new immigrants’ ability to secure employment and achieve economic self-sufficiency. In his 1994 essay “The Economics of Immigration,” economist George Borjas argued that since the 1980s, the United States has attracted “lower-quality” immigrants with less education and few marketable job skills. Moreover, they are less skilled than both natives (i.e., people born in the United States) and earlier migrants; thus, they are more reliant on government assistance. Borjas estimates that recent immigrants will likely earn 20 percent less than native-born Americans for most of their working lives. In terms of the effect of immigrants on natives’ economic prospects, Borjas argues that large-scale migration of less-skilled workers harms the economic opportunities of less-skilled natives—particularly African Americans. This occurs because immigrants increase the number of workers in the economy; as they create additional competition in the labor market, wages of the least-skilled workers fall.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Other economists and policy analysts claim that recent immigration has had either a positive effect or no influence on the U.S. economy. Economist Julian Simon (1981, 1989) has argued that immigrants benefit the U.S. economy by joining the labor force and paying into the federal revenue system for their whole lives. By the time they retire and collect government benefits such as Social Security and Medicare, their children will be covering these costs by working and paying into the tax system. Simon’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_404" title="404"></span>arguments, however, assume that immigrants earn the same wages and are as employable as natives—an assumption refuted by Borjas’s research.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Simon also holds that immigrants are a cultural asset to the United States. In fact, he claims that “the notion of wanting to keep out immigrants to keep our institutions and our values pure is prejudice” (quoted in Brimelow, 1995). He argues, moreover, that because human beings have the intelligence to adapt to their surroundings, the more immigrants that come to the United States, the larger the pool of potential innovators and problem solvers our nation will have.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Studies conducted by Simon and the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization, acknowledge that although some recent immigrants may benefit from federally funded programs such as welfare, these costs to the government are often quite short-term. Immigrant children who benefit from the U.S. educational system go on to become productive, taxpaying workers.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The National Immigration Forum has estimated that immigrant workers contribute significantly to the national economy. In 2017, immigrants represented 17 percent of the U.S. workforce; this includes about 4.6 percent of the workforce who are illegal immigrants (Radford, 2019). Even though most immigrants work in low-wage and hard-labor jobs, without them, the gross domestic product of the United States would be far less. Assessing the fiscal costs of immigration proves difficult, however. Although much of the public debate focuses on the costs of providing services to unauthorized immigrants, actual statistics documenting the number of unauthorized immigrants are difficult to obtain and verify. The Pew Research Center puts the population of unauthorized immigrants in the United States at 10.5 million in 2017. Furthermore, few policy analysts can predict whether U.S. immigration policy—or the characteristics of immigrants themselves—will change drastically in the future (Radford, 2019).</p>
