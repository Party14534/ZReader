<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Power is an ever-present phenomenon in social life. In all human groups, some individuals have more authority or influence than others, and groups themselves have varying degrees of power. Power and inequality are closely linked. The powerful are able to accumulate valued resources, such as property and wealth; possession of such resources in turn generates more power.</b></p>
