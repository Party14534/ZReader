<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Why Are Poverty Rates Rising in the United States? The Sociological Debate</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some theories see poor individuals as responsible for their own poverty, and other theories view poverty as produced and reproduced by structural forces in society. These approaches are sometimes described as “blame the victim” and “blame the system” theories, respectively. We shall briefly examine each.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There is a long history of attitudes holding the poor responsible for their own disadvantaged positions. For example, the poorhouses of the nineteenth century were grounded in a belief that the poor were unable—due to lack of skills, moral or physical weakness, absence of motivation, or below-average ability—to succeed in society. Social standing was seen to reflect a person’s talent and effort; those who deserved to succeed did so, while others less capable were doomed to fail.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Such outlooks reemerged in the 1970s and 1980s as the political emphasis on entrepreneurship and ambition rewarded those who “succeeded” and held those who did not succeed responsible for their unfortunate circumstances. Often, explanations for poverty targeted the lifestyles and attitudes of poor people. Oscar Lewis (1968) proposed one of the most influential theories, which argues that poverty results from a larger social and cultural atmosphere into which poor children are socialized. The <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-culture-of-poverty" href="part0057_split_005.html#culture-of-poverty">culture of poverty</a> is transmitted across generations <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_277" title="277"></span>because young people see little point in aspiring to something more. Instead, they resign themselves to a life of impoverishment.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The culture of poverty thesis was taken further by Charles Murray (1984), who controversially placed individuals who are poor through “no fault of their own”—such as widows or widowers, orphans, or the disabled—into a different category from those who are part of the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-dependency-culture" href="part0057_split_005.html#dependency-culture">dependency culture</a>. This term refers to poor people who rely on welfare rather than entering the labor market. Murray argued that the growth of the welfare state undermines personal ambition and the capacity for self-help; welfare erodes people’s incentive to work.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">An opposite approach to explaining poverty emphasizes larger social processes that are difficult for individuals to overcome. In this view, structural forces within society—differences in opportunity that are associated with race, class, gender, ethnicity, occupational position, educational attainment, and so forth—shape the way in which resources are distributed (Wilson, 1996, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_278" title="278"></span>2011). Advocates of this approach argue that the perceived lack of achievement among the poor is a consequence of their constrained situations, not a cause of it. Reducing poverty thus requires policy measures aimed at distributing income and resources more equally throughout society; such policy measures include child-care subsidies, a minimum hourly wage, and guaranteed income levels for families.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Surveys show that Americans are split on whether the poor are responsible for their plight. A Pew Research Center poll in 2018 found that 52 percent believe that poverty is the result of circumstances beyond people’s control, while 31 percent believe it is because people do not do enough to lift themselves out of poverty. This represents a significant shift in opinion from 20 years earlier, when less than a third of respondents believed poverty to be caused by conditions beyond one’s control, and more than half believed that the poor were responsible for their circumstances (Dunn, 2018). This shift in opinion may well reflect the lingering aftermath of the 2008 recession, which affected many working- and middle-class Americans, revealing to them that circumstances beyond one’s control can adversely affect one’s livelihood.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Both theories play a role in public debates about poverty. Critics of the “culture of poverty” thesis accuse its advocates of blaming the poor for circumstances beyond their control. They see the poor as victims, not as freeloaders. Most sociologists emphasize the systemic or structural causes of poverty. While individual initiative obviously plays a part, major advantages are conferred by being born higher up on the income and wealth ladder—and major disadvantages from being born at the bottom. Moreover, these advantages (or disadvantages) are amplified by what is happening in the U.S. economy. During a period of growth, new opportunities are created; a rising tide, as the expression goes, lifts all boats. During a time of economic decline, such as a recession, or stagnation, the poor suffer the most.</p>
