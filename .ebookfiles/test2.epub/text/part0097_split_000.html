<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-family" href="part0097_split_001.html#family">family</a> is a group of people directly linked by kin connections, the adult members of which take care of the children. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-kinship" href="part0097_split_001.html#kinship">Kinship</a> ties are connections among individuals, established either through marriage, the lines of descent that connect blood relatives (mothers, fathers, children, grandparents, etc.), or adoption. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-marriage" href="part0097_split_001.html#marriage">Marriage</a> can be defined as a socially acknowledged and approved sexual union between two adult individuals. When two people marry, they become kin to each other; however, the marriage bond also connects a wider range of kinspeople. Parents, brothers, sisters, and other blood relatives become relatives of the partner, or “in-laws,” through marriage.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Virtually all societies contain what sociologists and anthropologists call the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-nuclear-family" href="part0097_split_001.html#nuclear-family">nuclear family</a>, two adults living together in a household with their own or adopted <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_566" title="566"></span>children. In most traditional societies, the nuclear family was part of a larger kinship network. When close relatives, in addition to a married couple and children, live either in the same household or in a close and continuous relationship with one another, we speak of an <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-extended-family" href="part0097_split_001.html#extended-family">extended family</a>. An extended family may include grandparents, brothers and their wives, sisters and their husbands, aunts, nephews, and so on.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">(left) The Kazaks in Mongolia usually live in extended families and collectively herd their livestock. The youngest son will inherit the father’s house, and the elder sons will build their own houses close by when they get married. (right) Parents wait for the metro with their child. How is a nuclear family different from an extended family?</figcaption>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Whether nuclear or extended, families can be divided into <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-families-of-orientation" href="part0097_split_001.html#families-of-orientation">families of orientation</a>, or families of origin, and <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-families-of-procreation" href="part0097_split_001.html#families-of-procreation">families of procreation</a>. The first is the family into which a person is born or adopted. The second is the family into which one enters as an adult; for those who have children, it is the context in which a new generation of children is brought up. A further distinction concerns place of residence. In the United States, when two people marry, they do not necessarily set up their own household in the same area where either spouse’s parents live, although they often do so. In some other societies, however, married couples live close to or within the same dwelling as the parents of either or both spouses. When the couple lives near or with the female spouse’s parents, the arrangement is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-matrilocal" href="part0097_split_001.html#matrilocal">matrilocal</a>. In <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_567" title="567"></span>a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-patrilocal" href="part0097_split_001.html#patrilocal">patrilocal</a> pattern, the couple lives near or with the male spouse’s parents.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In Western societies, marriage, and therefore family, is associated with <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-monogamy" href="part0097_split_001.html#monogamy">monogamy</a>. It is illegal for a person to be married to more than one individual at any one time. But in several parts of the world, monogamy is far less common than it is in Western nations. In his classic research, George Murdock (1967, 1981) compared several hundred societies from 1960 through 1980 and found that <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-polygamy" href="part0097_split_001.html#polygamy">polygamy</a>, a marriage that allows a person to have more than one spouse, was permitted in over 80 percent of them (see also Gray, 1998). There are two types of polygamy: <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-polygyny" href="part0097_split_001.html#polygyny">polygyny</a>, in which a man may be married to more than one woman at the same time, and <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-polyandry" href="part0097_split_001.html#polyandry">polyandry</a>, much less common, in which a woman may have two or more husbands simultaneously. Of the 1,231 societies tracked, Murdock found that just 15 percent of societies were monogamous, 37 percent had occasional polygyny, 48 percent had more frequent polygyny, and less than 1 percent had polyandry (Murdock, 1981). In contemporary society, polygamy rates have been particularly high in Africa’s “polygamy belt” reaching from Senegal to Tanzania, where as many as one-third of women are in polygamous unions (Jacoby, 1995).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet recent work suggests that polygamy has grown less common over time due to social and economic conditions, including increasing levels of democracy, a declining acceptance of arranged marriage, an increase in marriages based on a desire for love and companionship, and strides in the education and human rights protections afforded to women. Polygyny is disadvantageous to women, and as such, has declined as women gain more rights and power in many parts of the world (Bailey and Kaufman, 2010).</p>
