<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Older adults are a potent voice in Washington, due both to their large and rapidly growing numbers and to their high levels of political engagement. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-aarp" href="part0081_split_004.html#aarp">AARP</a> (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons) is a highly effective advocate for the aged population. AARP is a nonprofit organization that boasts a membership of nearly 38 million Americans age 50 and older—reportedly the largest member-based organization in the world next to the Roman Catholic Church and approximately 8 times larger than the National Rifle Association (AARP, 2017; Birnbaum, 2005; Kessler, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Those 60 and older have high voter turnout rates—71 percent in the 2016 presidential election—compared to just 43 percent of those 18 to 24 years old (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2017n). This is not to suggest that all older adults hold the same political views; on the contrary, they are as politically heterogeneous as the other age groups. But on issues they perceive as affecting their interests, such as retirement pensions and health care reform, they are likely to have strong opinions. Moreover, because cuts in programs for older adults would shift the burden of supporting them to their families, opposition to significant reductions in these programs is likely to be widespread.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because there is “strength in numbers,” some observers have argued that older adults have undue political influence and may benefit from government programs more than younger persons. Others counter, however, that older adults are entitled to programs such as Social Security and Medicare on the grounds of both equity and social justice (Kotlikoff and Burns, 2012). Yet as the large baby boom cohort, 75 million strong, enters later life, social scientists and policy makers are in heated debates over whether the federal government can afford to provide these benefits to older adults in coming years (Urban Institute, 2010). Such debates extend beyond the borders of the United States; throughout the globe, social scientists and policy makers wrestle with whether and how the planet can fairly provide services to an unprecedented number of older adults, sometimes dubbed the “gray tsunami” (O’Neill, 2009).</p>
