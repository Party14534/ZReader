<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-global-inequality" href="part0060_split_006.html#global-inequality">Global inequality</a> refers to the systematic differences in wealth and power among countries. These differences exist alongside differences within countries: Even the wealthiest countries have growing numbers of poor people. Yet it is important to remember that while some less wealthy nations, such as China, India, or Mexico are producing many of the world’s superrich, there is still a huge difference between being poor in a wealthy nation such as the United States, and starving to death in a poor nation. Sociology’s challenge is not merely to identify such differences but to explain why they occur—and how they might be overcome.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The most commonly used way to classify countries in terms of global inequality is to compare the wealth produced by each country for its average citizen. The gross national income, or <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-gni" href="part0060_split_006.html#gni">GNI</a>, is a measure of the total income earned as a result of a country’s yearly output of goods and services, including any income earned abroad. We use GNI here, rather than the more commonly used gross domestic product (GDP), since the latter includes only income produced within the country. When divided by the number of people in a country, this provides one commonly used estimate of average (per person) income. The World Bank (Prydz and Wadhwa, 2019), an international lending organization that provides loans for development projects in poorer countries, uses this measure to classify countries as either high income (based on an annual 2019 average per person income greater than of $12,375), upper-middle income ($3,996–$12,375), lower-middle income ($1,026–$3,995), or low income ($1,025 or less). This system of classification is often used to show the vast differences in living standards that exist among countries. The World Bank in 2019 identified 80 countries (out of 218) as high income, 60 as upper-middle income, 47 as lower-middle income, and 31 as low income (World Bank, 2019g).</p>
