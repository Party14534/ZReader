<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Sociological Theories of Health and Illness</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of contemporary sociologists’ main concerns is the experience of physical and mental disease or illness—how individuals experience being sick, chronically ill, or disabled and how these experiences are shaped by one’s social interactions with others. If you have ever been ill, even for a short period, you know that patterns of daily life are temporarily modified and your interactions with others change. This is because the normal functioning of the body is a vital, but often taken-for-granted, part of our daily lives. Our sense of self is predicated on the expectation that our bodies will facilitate, not impede, our social interactions and daily activities.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Illness has both personal and public dimensions. When we become ill, not only do we experience pain, discomfort, confusion, and other challenges, but others are affected as well. In the case of infectious diseases like COVID-19, we can infect other people with whom we live, work, and interact. When we ail from other conditions, our friends, families, and coworkers may extend sympathy, care, support, and assistance with practical tasks. They may struggle to understand our illness or to adjust the patterns of their own lives to accommodate it. Many try to make sense of the illness or figure out the cause of the health problem. Those we encounter react to our illness; their reactions, in turn, shape our own interpretations and can pose challenges to our sense of self. For instance, a long-time smoker who develops lung disease may be made to feel guilt or shame by family members.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Two sociological perspectives on the experience of illness have been particularly influential. The first perspective, associated with the functionalist school, proposes <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_719" title="719"></span>that “being sick” is a social role, just as “worker” or “mother” is a social role. As such, unhealthy persons are expected to comply with a widely agreed-upon set of behavioral expectations. The second perspective, favored by symbolic interactionists, explores how the meanings of illness are socially constructed and how these meanings influence people’s behavior.</p>

<section id="functionalist-perspectives-sick-role-theory">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Functionalist Perspectives: Sick Role Theory</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The functionalist theorist Talcott Parsons (1951) developed the notion of the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-sick-role" href="part0117_split_004.html#sick-role">sick role</a> to describe patterns of behavior that the sick person adopts to minimize the disruptive impact of illness. Functionalist thought holds that society usually operates in a smooth and consensual manner. Illness is, therefore, seen as a dysfunction that can disrupt the flow of this normal state. A sick individual, for example, might be unable to perform standard responsibilities or be less reliable and efficient than usual. Because sick people cannot carry out their normal roles, the lives of people around them are disrupted: Assignments at work go unfinished and cause stress for coworkers, responsibilities at home are not fulfilled, and so forth.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_720" title="720"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to Parsons, people learn the sick role through socialization and enact it, with the cooperation of others, when they fall ill. As with other social roles, such as gender roles, sick persons face societal expectations for how to behave; at the same time, other members of society abide by a generally agreed-upon set of expectations for how they will treat the sick individual. The sick role is distinguished by three sets of normative expectations:</p>
<ol class="fmnl">
<li class="bcpt" value="1"><span>The sick person is not held personally responsible for his or her poor health. Illness is seen as the result of physical causes beyond the individual’s control.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="2"><span>The sick person is entitled to certain rights and privileges, including a release from normal responsibilities. Since the sick person bears no responsibility for the illness, he or she is exempted from certain duties, roles, and behaviors. For example, a sick adult might be released from normal household duties; a sick child, excused from attending school. Behavior that is not as polite or thoughtful as usual or an unkempt appearance might be excused. The sick person gains the right to stay in bed, for example, or to take time off from work. A person with mental illness who allegedly commits a crime may be found “not guilty by reason of insanity.”</span></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="3"><span>The sick person is expected to take sensible steps to regain his or her health, such as consulting a medical expert and agreeing to become a patient. To occupy the sick role, the sick person’s claim of illness should be corroborated by a medical professional who legitimates the claim. Such confirmation allows those surrounding the sick person to accept the validity of his or her claims. Without such confirmation, the sick person may be viewed as a malingerer, or one who feigns health problems to avoid his or her obligations. A sick person who refuses to consult a doctor or who does not heed the advice of a medical authority puts his or her sick role status in jeopardy. To revisit an earlier example, a mentally ill person on trial for committing a crime may be ordered by the court to take psychotropic medications to treat his or her symptoms.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Over the past six decades, sociologists have refined Parsons’s sick role theory. They argue that the experience of the sick role varies with the type of illness, since people’s reactions to a sick person vary according to the severity of the illness and their perception of its nature and cause. Thus, not all people will uniformly experience the rights and privileges that accompany the sick role. Eliot Freidson (1970) identified three versions of the sick role that correspond with different types of illness. The conditional sick role applies to individuals suffering from a temporary condition that ultimately will be cured. The sick person is expected to get well and receives some rights and privileges according to the severity of the illness. For example, someone with a serious and potentially life-threatening condition like coronavirus would reap more benefits than someone with a common cold.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The unconditionally legitimate sick role refers to individuals who are suffering from incurable or terminal illnesses. Because the sick person cannot do anything to get well, he or she is automatically entitled to occupy the sick role. The expectation that one will seek timely medical care may be relaxed, because care-seeking may be futile for some health conditions. The unconditionally legitimate role might apply to individuals with alopecia (total hair loss) or severe acne (in both cases, there are no special privileges but rather an acknowledgment that the individual is not responsible for the illness), or <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_721" title="721"></span>with cancer or Parkinson’s disease, which result in important privileges and the right to abandon many duties.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The third sick role is the <i class="italic">illegitimate</i> role, which applies when an individual suffers from a disease or condition that is stigmatized by others. In such cases, there is a sense that the individual might be partially responsible for his or her illness; additional rights and privileges are not necessarily granted. HIV/AIDS is perhaps the most vivid example of a historically stigmatized illness that affects a sufferer’s perceived right to assume the sick role. Some HIV/AIDS patients may be held “responsible” for their condition and may be judged negatively for having engaged in high-risk behaviors such as unprotected sex or the use of unclean needles. Pediatric AIDS patients, those who contracted AIDS through a tainted blood transfusion, or other persons perceived to be “innocent” victims, by contrast, may be spared stigmatization.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Critiques of Sick Role Theory</b> Although the sick role model reveals how the ill person is an integral part of a larger social context, a number of criticisms can be leveled against it. Some argue that the sick role formula does not adequately capture the <i class="italic">lived experience</i> of illness. Others point out that it cannot be applied across all contexts, cultures, and historical periods. For example, it does not account for instances when doctors and patients disagree about a diagnosis or have opposing interests. It also fails to explain illnesses that do not necessarily lead to a suspension of normal activity, such as alcoholism, certain disabilities, and some chronic diseases. Furthermore, adopting the sick role is not always a straightforward process. Some individuals who suffer for years from chronic pain or from misdiagnosed symptoms are denied the sick role until they get a clear diagnosis. Other sick people, such as young adults with autoimmune diseases, often appear physically healthy despite constant physical pain and exhaustion; because of their “healthy” outward appearance, they may not be readily granted sick role status. In other cases, social factors such as race, class, and gender can affect whether and how readily the sick role is granted. The sick role cannot be divorced from the social, cultural, and economic influences that surround it.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The realities of life and illness are more complex than the sick role suggests. The leading causes of death in the twenty-first century are heart disease and cancer, two diseases that are associated with unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, a high-fat diet, and a sedentary lifestyle. Given the emphasis on taking control over one’s health and lifestyle in our modern age, individuals bear ever-greater responsibility for their own well-being. This sense of responsibility contradicts the first premise of the sick role—that the individual is not to blame for his or her illness. Moreover, sick role theory is less useful for understanding chronic illness (versus infectious disease) because there is no single formula for chronically ill or disabled people to follow. Moreover, chronically ill persons often find that their symptoms fluctuate, so that they feel and appear healthy on some days, yet experience debilitating symptoms on other days. Living with illness is experienced and interpreted in multiple ways.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Symbolic Interactionist Approaches: Illness as “Lived Experience”</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Symbolic interactionists study the ways people interpret the social world and the meanings they ascribe to it. Many sociologists have applied this approach to health and illness and view this perspective as a partial corrective to the limitations of functionalist approaches to health. Symbolic interactionists are not concerned with identifying risk <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_722" title="722"></span>factors for specific illnesses. Rather, they address questions such as: How do people react and adjust to news about a serious illness? How does illness shape individuals’ daily lives? How does living with a chronic illness affect an individual’s self-identity?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One theme that sociologists address is how chronically ill individuals cope with the practical and emotional implications of their illness. Certain illnesses require regular treatments or maintenance that can affect daily routines. Undergoing dialysis or insulin injections or taking large numbers of pills requires individuals to adjust their schedules. Some illnesses have unpredictable effects, such as violent nausea or sudden loss of bowel or bladder control. People suffering from such conditions often develop strategies for managing their illness in daily life. These include practical considerations—such as noting the location of the restrooms when in an unfamiliar place—as well as skills for managing interpersonal relations, both intimate and commonplace. Although symptoms can be embarrassing and disruptive, people develop coping strategies to live as normally as possible (Kelly, 1992).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">At the same time, the experience of illness can pose challenges to and changes in people’s sense of self. These develop not only through the reactions of other people but also through the ill person’s perception of those reactions. For the chronically ill or disabled, routine social interactions become tinged with risk or uncertainty, and interpretations of common situations may differ substantially. An ill person may need assistance but not want to appear dependent, for example. A healthy individual may feel sympathy for someone diagnosed with an illness but might be unsure whether to address the subject directly. The changed context of social interactions can precipitate transformations in self-identity.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some sociologists have investigated how individuals with chronic physical or mental illness manage their symptoms and treatments within the overall context of their lives (Jobling, 1988; Williams, 1993). Illness can place enormous demands on people’s time, energy, strength, and emotional reserves. Serious illness can also tax the emotional resources of loved ones. Corbin and Strauss (1985) identified three types of “work” incorporated into the everyday strategies of the chronically ill. <i class="italic">Illness work</i> refers to activities involved in managing the condition, such as taking medications, doing diagnostic tests, or undergoing physical therapy. <i class="italic">Everyday work</i> pertains to the management of daily life, such as maintaining relationships with others, running household affairs, and pursuing professional or personal interests. <i class="italic">Biographical work</i> involves the process of incorporating the illness into one’s life, making sense of it, and developing ways of explaining it to others. Such a process can help people with mental and physical illness restore meaning and order to their lives.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Each of these processes of adaptation may be particularly difficult for those who suffer from a stigmatized health condition, such as extreme obesity, alcoholism, schizophrenia, HIV/AIDS, or lung cancer. Sociologist Erving Goffman (1963) developed the concept of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-stigma" href="part0117_split_004.html#stigma">stigma</a>, which refers to any personal characteristic that is devalued in a particular social context. Stigmas typically come in one of three forms: “abominations of the body” (such as disfigurement, disability, or obesity), “tribal stigma of race, nation, or religion” (such as belonging to a historically denigrated racial or ethnic group), and “blemishes of individual character” (such as laziness, lack of personal <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_723" title="723"></span>control, or immorality). Stigmatized individuals and groups often are treated with suspicion, hostility, or discrimination.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some ill persons, particularly those marked by “abominations of the body,” may arouse feelings of sympathy or compassion, especially if they are not held responsible for their illness. They may even receive special privileges. For example, one study showed that adolescents offered much less critical appraisals of overweight persons when they believed that the weight was caused by a thyroid problem, and thus was due to a biological factor rather than to a character flaw such as laziness or lack of self-control (Dejong, 1993). Studies are less conclusive regarding mental illness; some find that diagnosing mental illness as a “brain disease” (and thus beyond one’s control) diminishes the stigma, whereas others show that attributing mental illness to genetic factors does not minimize society’s negative views (e.g., Corrigan and Watson, 2004; Phelan et al., 2005).</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">Symbolic interactionists are interested in how illnesses shape individuals’ daily lives. For example, people with diabetes must constantly monitor their blood sugar levels.</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">By contrast, when a health condition is viewed as indicative of a “character blemish,” such as sexual promiscuity or gluttony, then the healthy population may reject the sufferers. Similarly, throughout history, many infectious diseases, especially those contracted by the poor, were often stigmatized and viewed as indicators of shame and dishonor. This occurred in the Middle Ages with leprosy, when people were isolated in leper colonies. HIV/AIDS often provokes such stigmatization today—in spite of the fact that, as with leprosy, the risk of contracting the disease in ordinary situations is almost nonexistent. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS reports incidences in Kerala, India, when children infected with HIV have been barred from schools and denied any interaction with other children (U.N. Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS [UNAIDS], 2003).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Stigmas are, however, rarely based on valid understandings or scientific data. They spring from stereotypes or perceptions that may be false or only partially correct. Further, the nature of a stigma <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_724" title="724"></span>varies widely across sociocultural contexts: The extent to which a trait is devalued depends on the values and beliefs of those who do the stigmatizing. For instance, in the United States, obese persons are much more likely to be stigmatized by White upper-middle-class persons than they are to be stigmatized by African Americans or working-class Whites (Carr and Friedman, 2005). By contrast, other health conditions, including major mental illness and HIV/AIDS (as we will read about later in this chapter), are much more widely stigmatized. One recent study of 16 countries, including the United States and nations in Europe, Africa, and Asia, found that even in the most liberal, tolerant countries, the majority of the public held stigmatizing attitudes and a willingness to exclude people with schizophrenia from close, personal relationships and positions of authority, seeing them as unpredictable and potentially dangerous (Pescosolido et al., 2013).</p>
