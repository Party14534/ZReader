<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Recently, sociologists have looked at how the proliferation of smartphones and the rise of social media are changing how boys and girls interact in public spaces. For teenagers in low-income urban areas, the street has long served as a hub of social life and dating. Street interactions between boys and girls may incorporate aspects of both courtship and the incivility that characterizes street talk between adult men and women who are strangers. Today, these encounters are reshaped online, or what urban sociologist Jeffrey Lane refers to as the “digital street.” Lane (2018) studied a cohort of teenagers in Harlem and found that boys and girls had changed the experience of public space by using social media to buffer interaction. Whereas boys were more visible and acted more dominant toward girls on the sidewalk, girls gained visibility and control online.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While for some of the boys in Lane’s study, social media provided <i class="italic">another,</i> alternative way to call out to girls, other boys engaged girls digitally <i class="italic">instead</i> of on the sidewalk. Messaging girls in private, rather than approaching them face to face on the sidewalk, shielded boys from public rejection in front of their friends when advances went unmet. But private messages were not necessarily the best strategy. Christian, one of the teenagers in Lane’s study, explained that “a girl hates” when a boy writes “a million messages, like, ‘What’s up, I’m trying to talk to you.’” Instead, Lane found that a girl would rather a boy like one of her photos and then leave the girl to make the next move. The use of social media enabled ways to communicate at different distances and paces that steered teens either away from or toward meetings in person.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Lane argued that girls and, to a lesser extent, boys were safer with social media. But traditionally gendered norms of interaction and roles also carried forward. For instance, boys and girls alike articulated the pressure on young women to objectify their bodies online. “Girls get naked for likes,” said one 18-year-old girl in Lane’s research. False identity was another issue. Unlike in physical space, appearance and person may decouple online in the case of “fake pages” or “catfishes”—profiles that depict someone other than its user. The possibility of a fake page created trust issues among boys and girls, and these issues were compounded by the fact that law enforcement used profiles designed to mimic girls in the neighborhood to monitor and gather intelligence on boys of interest.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The role of social media raises new questions of how people come to find and know each other today. Do people have more understanding or even control over the people around them and their potential meetings? Or are people newly vulnerable online?</p>
