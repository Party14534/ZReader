<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-work" href="part0091_split_001.html#work">Work</a> can be defined as the carrying out of tasks that require the expenditure of mental and physical effort; it has as its objective the production of goods and services that cater to human needs. An <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-occupation" href="part0091_split_001.html#occupation">occupation</a>, or job, is work that is done in exchange for a <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_511" title="511"></span>regular wage, or salary. In all cultures, work is the basis of the economic system, or <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-economy" href="part0091_split_001.html#economy">economy</a>. The economy consists of institutions that provide for the production and distribution of goods and services.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Modern societies are capitalistic. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-capitalism" href="part0091_split_001.html#capitalism">Capitalism</a> is an economic system based on the private ownership of wealth, which is invested and reinvested in order to produce profit. It is distinguished by the following important features: Private ownership of the means of production; profit as incentive; competition for markets to sell goods, acquire cheap materials, and use cheap labor; and restless expansion and investment to accumulate capital. Capitalism, which began to spread with the growth of the Industrial Revolution in the early nineteenth century, is a vastly more dynamic economic system than any other that preceded it in history. Although the system has had many critics, such as Karl Marx, it is now the most widespread form of economic organization in the world.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Modern industry differs in a fundamental way from premodern systems of production, which were primarily based on agriculture. In modern societies, in contrast, most people no longer work on farms or in fields. In economically advanced economies such as the United States, large numbers no longer work in factories, as was the case for much of the twentieth century. Rather, in such countries today’s jobs involve providing services to others—services that range from those contributed by high-paid professionals, such as managers of giant corporations, to those administered by low-paid workers requiring limited skills and training, such as salesclerks at Walmart.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The study of economic institutions is of major importance in sociology because the economy influences all segments of society and, therefore, social life in general. And economic institutions are themselves always changing. One reason for such change is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-technology" href="part0091_split_001.html#technology">technology</a>, which harnesses science to machinery, electronics, and even biology to produce an ever-increasing variety of goods more cheaply. Another reason is globalization, which creates global competition among not only firms but also workers: Whether you are an autoworker in a Detroit factory, an engineer in Silicon Valley, or a graphic designer in New York City, someone half a world away likely has the skill, talent, and drive to challenge you for your job.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We often associate the notion of work with drudgery—a set of tasks that we want to minimize and, if possible, escape altogether. (You may have this very thought in mind as you set out to read this chapter!) Is <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_512" title="512"></span>this most people’s attitude toward their work, and, if so, why? We will try to find out in the following pages.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Work is more than just drudgery, or people would not feel so lost and disoriented when they become unemployed. How would you feel if you thought you would never get a job? In modern societies, having a paid job is important for maintaining self-esteem, as well as paying the bills. Even where work conditions are relatively unpleasant, and the tasks involved are dull, work tends to be a structuring element in people’s psychological makeup and the cycle of their daily activities. Several characteristics of work are relevant here.</p>
<ul class="contents">
<li class="bcpt"><span><i class="italic">Money.</i> A wage or salary is the main resource many people depend on to meet their needs. Without such an income, anxieties about coping with day-to-day life tend to multiply.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span><i class="italic">Activity level.</i> Work often provides a basis for the acquisition and exercise of skills and capacities. Even where work is routine, it offers a structured environment in which a person’s energies may be absorbed. Without it, the opportunity to exercise such skills and capacities may be reduced.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span><i class="italic">Variety.</i> Work provides access to contexts that contrast with domestic surroundings. In the working environment, even when the tasks are relatively dull, individuals may enjoy doing something different from home chores.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span><i class="italic">Structuring one’s time.</i> For people in regular employment, the day is usually organized around the rhythm of work. Although work may sometimes be oppressive, it provides a sense of direction in daily activities. Those who are out of work frequently find boredom a major problem and may develop a sense of apathy about time.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span><i class="italic">Social contacts.</i> The work environment often provides friendships and opportunities to participate in shared activities with others. Separated from the work setting, a person’s circle of possible friends and acquaintances is likely to dwindle.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span><i class="italic">Personal identity.</i> Work is usually valued for the sense of stable social identity it offers. For men in particular, self-esteem is often bound up with the economic contribution they make to maintaining the household. In addition, job conditions—such as the opportunity to work in jobs that are challenging, not routinized, and not subject to close supervision—are known to have a positive effect on a person’s sense of self-worth (Crowley, 2014).</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Against the backdrop of this formidable list, it is not difficult to see why being without paid employment may undermine individuals’ confidence in their social value. Yet even though we often think of work as equivalent to having a paid job, in fact, this is an oversimplified view. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-housework" href="part0091_split_001.html#housework">Housework</a>, which has traditionally been carried out mostly by women, is usually unpaid. But it is work nonetheless, sometimes satisfying, often difficult and exhausting. Unpaid housework includes such things as having primary responsibility for raising children, cleaning, shopping, and attending to countless (and unending) household chores. It typically involves one of the most important tasks of any society: the socialization of children, a crucial step in preparing them for adulthood.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One study found that in 1965, women put in an average of 40 hours per week on household work. Today, as an increasing number of women have joined the paid workforce, it is estimated that women spend approximately half that amount of time each week on household labor. Men have not exactly taken up the slack: Their weekly <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_513" title="513"></span>contribution in 1965 was 14 hours; today it is roughly the same. On an average day, one out of every five men did housework such as cleaning or laundry, compared with half of all women (BLS, 2019b). When men do household work, the work they do tends to be gendered: men are more likely to do outdoor work or repairs that can fit into their schedules, while women are more likely to do such routine daily work as shopping, house cleaning, laundry, and child care (Quadlin and Doan, 2018). According to one estimate, if housework were monetized—that is, paid according to its true value—it would have increased the U.S. GNI (gross national income) by nearly $1.5 trillion (Wezerek and Ghodsee, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another form of unpaid labor that has an important social role involves volunteer work for charities or other organizations. According to one estimate, in 2018, about 63 million Americans—over one-fifth of all adults—contributed 8 billion hours of volunteer service, estimated as worth $203 billion (Independent Sector, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the most distinctive characteristics of the economic system of modern societies is the existence of a highly complex <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-division-of-labor" href="part0091_split_001.html#division-of-labor">division of labor</a>: Work has become divided into an enormous number of different occupations in which people specialize. In traditional societies, nonagricultural work entailed the mastery of a craft. Workers learned craft skills through a lengthy period of apprenticeship, with the worker normally carrying out all aspects of the production process from beginning to end. For example, a metalworker making a plow would forge the iron, shape it, and assemble the implement itself. With the rise of modern industrial production, most traditional crafts have disappeared altogether, replaced by skills that form part of more large-scale production processes. An electrician working in an industrial setting today, for instance, may inspect and repair only a few parts of one type of machine; different people will deal with the other parts and other machines.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The contrast in the division of labor between traditional and modern societies is truly extraordinary. Even in the largest traditional societies, there usually existed no more than 20 or 30 major craft trades, together with such specialized pursuits as merchant, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_514" title="514"></span>soldier, and priest. A modern industrial system has literally thousands of occupations. The U.S. Census Bureau lists more than 31,000 different jobs in the American economy (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2016i). In traditional communities, most of the population worked on farms and were economically self-sufficient. They produced their own food, clothes, and other necessities of life. One of the main features of modern societies, by contrast, is an enormous expansion of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-economic-interdependence" href="part0091_split_001.html#economic-interdependence">economic interdependence</a>. We all depend on an immense number of other workers—today stretching right across the world—for the products and services that sustain our lives. With few exceptions, the vast majority of people in modern societies do not grow the food they eat, build the houses in which they live, or produce the material goods they consume. Moreover, as you learned from the chapter opener, the division of labor is now truly global, since the components of virtually all products are sourced from many factories in different countries.</p>
