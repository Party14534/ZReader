<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Social Patterning of Health and Illness in the United States</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the most enduring patterns social epidemiologists have documented is the persistence of health inequalities, where members of those social groups with more status, prestige, power, and economic resources typically enjoy better physical and mental health. Although we see some exceptions to this rule—for example, women <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_729" title="729"></span>currently live longer than men in the United States, despite persistent earnings differences between the two groups—the social class and Black-White gaps have endured, and even widened, over the last several decades. We now provide evidence of these patterns and offer explanations for why they persist.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Social Class–Based Inequalities in Health</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In <a href="part0053_split_000.html#1IHDQ0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 8</a>, we defined <i class="italic">social class</i> as a concept that encompasses education, income, occupation, and assets. In U.S. society, people with more education, higher incomes, and more prestigious occupations have better health. What is fascinating is that each of these dimensions of social class may be related to health and mortality for different reasons.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Income is the most obvious dimension. In countries such as the United States, where medical care is expensive and many people have historically lacked insurance, those with the richest financial resources have better access to physicians and medicine. But inequalities in health also persist in countries that have national health insurance, such as Great Britain. The landmark <i class="italic">Black Report</i> revealed that social inequalities in health and mortality in the United Kingdom had not diminished since the implementation of the National Health Service (NHS) but had instead increased (Townsend and Davidson, 1982). Yet, part of this growing gap was due to improvements in mortality among the wealthier classes and not due to declines among the lower socioeconomic groups. This suggested that the upper classes were making greater (or somehow “better”) use of the improved access to medical resources. Thus, we must think beyond income and consider the other dimensions of social class: occupational status and education.</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Differences in occupational status may lead to inequalities in health and illness even when medical care is fairly evenly distributed. One study of health inequalities in Great Britain (Townsend and Davidson, 1982) found that manual workers had substantially higher mortality rates than professional workers, even though Britain’s health service had made great strides in equalizing the distribution of health care. Indeed, different occupations are associated with different levels of health risks. Those who work in offices or domestic settings have less risk of injury or exposure to hazardous materials. Jobs can be dangerous in one of two ways: conditions that increase one’s risk of on-the-job accidents, and continuous exposure to dangerous or stressful conditions that eventually hasten one’s death.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2019m), 9 of the 10 most “fatal” jobs in 2018 due to occupational injuries were manual labor jobs, including logger, fisherman, aircraft pilots and flight <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_730" title="730"></span>engineers, roofer, refuse and recyclable material collector, drivers/sales workers, and truck drivers, farmer, rancher, and other agricultural worker, steel worker, first-line supervisors of construction trades and extraction workers, and groundskeeper. Public-service jobs such as police officer, firefighter, and military personnel also placed their workers at heightened risk of accidental or sudden death (BLS, 2014). Other jobs are hazardous because they expose their workers to dangerous conditions over time, ultimately leading to disease and death. Other work settings are hazardous because they expose their employees to infectious diseases. Workers in long-term care settings like nursing homes are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 because their workplaces them in confined spaces with older adults suffering from the disease. Nursing home workers need to move from room to room assisting patients and serving them meals, heightening their own risk (Yourish et al., 2020). In general, industrial-based disease is difficult to calculate because it is hard to determine whether an illness is acquired from working conditions or from other sources. However, some work-related diseases are well documented: Lung disease is widespread in mining, as a result of dust inhalation; work with asbestos has been shown to produce certain types of cancer (BLS, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Education is also a powerful predictor of health, where those with higher levels of education have longer life spans than persons with fewer years of schooling. In recent years, the least-educated Americans—especially women—have actually experienced a decrease in life expectancy, while all other groups have experienced gains (Cockerham, 2014). Not only do high school dropouts die younger than persons with higher levels of education, but they also have experienced an absolute decline in life expectancy, or the number of years they live, since the 1990s (Olshansky, Antonucci, and Berkman et al., 2012). A recent study found that life expectancy increased for college-educated people and declined for persons without a four-year college degree. Closer inspection of these differences found that rates of “deaths of despair” from suicide and drug abuse are particularly high among those with less education (Case and Deaton, 2020; Sasson and Hayward, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What accounts for the steep educational gradient in life span today? Numerous studies find a positive correlation between education and a broad array of preventive health behaviors. Better-educated people are significantly more likely to engage in aerobic exercise and to know their blood pressure (Shea et al., 1991) and less likely to smoke (Kenkel, Lillard, and Mathios, 2006) or be overweight (Himes, 1999). By contrast, poorly educated people engage in more cigarette smoking; they also have more problems with cholesterol and body weight (Winkleby et al., 1992). People with low levels of education also are less likely to have health insurance and are more likely to misuse and even overdose on prescription medications (Tavernise, 2012). More highly educated people also respond differently to health threats. One study of smokers found that after suffering a heart attack, highly educated persons were much more likely than poorly educated persons to quit smoking (Wray et al., 1998). Lest we jump to the conclusion that persons with less education make “bad choices,” sociologists have acknowledged that access to safe places to exercise, grocery stores with healthy foods, and other heath-enhancing amenities are more common in higher-income neighborhoods (Althschuler et al., 2004).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Mental health is similarly affected by social class–based inequalities. In general, persons with lower levels of education and income fare worse along most mental <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_731" title="731"></span>health outcomes, including risk of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. The stressors related to economic adversity, including unsatisfying jobs, strained marriages, and worries about money and one’s personal safety, may overwhelm one’s ability to cope. The COVID-19 crisis is a case in point; stay-at-home orders, rampant business shut-downs, and job loss are stressful for everyone, but are most overwhelming for low-income persons who live paycheck to paycheck and don’t have ample savings to sustain them during periods of layoff or furlough. Depressive symptoms (feelings of profound sadness and hopelessness) and anxiety (nervousness about one’s daily experiences) are emotional consequences of living under persistently stressful circumstances (Carr, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most social epidemiologists view education as the most important of the three dimensions of socioeconomic status in predicting health. This is because education is associated with a broad range of traits that promote positive health behaviors, including high levels of perceived control over one’s environment (Mirowsky and Ross, 2005) and <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-health-literacy" href="part0118_split_005.html#health-literacy">health literacy</a>, which refers to one’s capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions (Zarcadoolas et al., 2006). Understanding one’s health risks and having the means to do something about them are core components of the health-belief model (Becker, 1974; Rosenstock, 1974), which provides a framework for understanding why some individuals participate in positive health behaviors while others do not. The model proposes that individuals’ decisions to engage in positive health behaviors (or to change their health behaviors) are based on their evaluation of the possible threat a health condition poses and the perceived benefits of, and barriers to, taking action to prevent getting the health condition. Both evaluating one’s level of threat and developing a strategy to minimize risk are clearly shaped by social-structural factors.</p>

<section id="race-based-inequalities-in-health">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Race-Based Inequalities in Health</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Blacks fare worse than Whites in the United States on nearly all health indicators, ranging from body weight to mortality rates to risk of major illnesses like diabetes and cancer. Life expectancy at birth in 2015 was about 81 years for White females but 78.5 years for Black females. Likewise, life expectancy at birth in 2015 was about 76 years for White males yet less than 72 years for Black males (Figure 18.1). An even more startling gap emerges when early life mortality is considered: Black infants have more than twice the mortality rate of White infants. Roughly 11 Black infants per every 1,000 born in 2014 died in their first year of life, compared to about 5 deaths per 1,000 for White and Hispanic infants (Arias et al., 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Racial differences in health reveal the complex interplay among race, social class, and culture. A powerful example of the multiple ways that race affects health is the Hispanic health paradox: Although Hispanics in the United States have poorer socioeconomic resources than Whites, on average, their health—and especially the health of their infants—is just as good as, if not better than, that of Whites. Blacks, by contrast, face economic disadvantages that are similar to those of Hispanics, yet Blacks do <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_732" title="732"></span>not enjoy the health benefits Hispanics experience. Experts attribute Hispanics’ health advantage relative to Blacks’ to cultural factors such as social cohesion but also to methodological factors. Studies of Hispanic health in the United States focus on those Hispanics who successfully migrated to the United States; as such, they are believed to be in better health, or more robust, than those who remained in their native countries (Perea, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A closer inspection of Blacks’ health and mortality disadvantage further reveals the multiple ways that race matters for health. One of the main reasons for Blacks’ health disadvantage is that Blacks as a group have less money than Whites. The median wealth of White households is roughly 14 times that of Black households and 10 times that of Hispanic households (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2017l). And the median income of a Black man is less than 59 percent that of a White man (Proctor, Semega, and Kollar, 2016). In 2016, the median wealth of Black and Hispanic households was $17,600 and $20,700, respectively. Meanwhile, the median wealth of White families was $171,000 (Hanks, Solomon, and Weller, 2018). Yet the differences in Black and White health go beyond economic causes and reflect other important aspects of the social and cultural landscape. Consider racial gaps in mortality. The rise in violent crime in the late 1980s accompanied the rise of widespread crack cocaine addiction, mainly affecting poor African American neighborhoods that were plagued by high levels of unemployment (Wilson, 1996). Homicide victimization rates for all races have declined considerably over the past 20 years, yet the stark racial gap persists: The murder rate for young Black males is ten times higher than for their White peers (Widra, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Other race-based inequalities in health status, health behaviors, and health care are also stark. There is a higher prevalence of hypertension among Blacks, especially Black men—a difference that may be partly biological. Early evidence also suggests that Blacks are more likely than Whites to contract and die from COVID-19. There are many reasons why, including the jobs they work in, greater use of public transit, less access to health care, higher rates of underlying health conditions, living in crowded housing with extended family members, and higher rates of living in institutions like prisons where infection rates are very high (CDC, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Despite the persistence of Black-White disparities in health and health behaviors, some progress has been made in eradicating them. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, racial differences in cigarette smoking have decreased (CDC, 2017a). In 1965, half of White men and 60 percent of Black men age 18 and over smoked cigarettes. By 2015, 16.8 percent of White men and 20.3 percent of Black men smoked. In 1965, roughly equal proportions of Black and White women age 18 and older smoked (33 and 34 percent, respectively). This equivalence was preserved in 2015, with 13.2 percent of Black women and 14.8 percent of White women smoking.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Hypertension among Blacks also has been greatly reduced, yet rates remain high. In the early 1970s, half of Black adults between the ages of 20 and 74 suffered from hypertension. During 2015–2016, roughly 40 percent of Black adults, compared to 28 percent of White adults, suffered from hypertension (Fryar et al., 2017). Despite the overall decline, this rate is still high and may reflect the currently high and rising rates of obesity among Black women. Eighty-two percent of Black women are considered overweight or obese, as compared to almost 64 percent of White women (CDC, 2017a). Black women also are far less likely than White women to exercise regularly, a pattern that most social scientists attribute to their hectic schedules of juggling work <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_733" title="733"></span>and family and the high costs of fitness programs and gym memberships (August and Sorkin, 2010). However, in 2011, then-U.S. surgeon general Regina M. Benjamin drew attention and some ridicule by suggesting that Black women avoid exercise because it may ruin their hair; Black women often spend considerable time and money on treatments such as hair relaxers (Versey, 2014). A recent study by the University of Ohio found that while many clinicians engage Black women in conversations regarding exercise and weight, only about 25 percent ever discuss practical implications of hair maintenance. The study highlighted hair maintenance as a barrier to regular exercise (Tolliver et al., 2019).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Patterns of physician visitation, hospitalization, and preventive medicine also have improved, yet racial equity remains elusive. For example, Black women historically have been less likely than White women to receive mammograms. This gap has narrowed in recent years. In fact, in 2015, a higher proportion of Black women (72 percent) than White women (68 percent) had had a mammogram within the past two years (CDC, 2017a). However, some studies suggest that Black women delay receiving mammograms, and thus, those with breast cancer have their condition detected at a later—and more dangerous—stage of the disease’s progression. Tumors in more advanced stages increase one’s mortality risk and impede the effectiveness of potential treatments (Smith-Bindman et al., 2006). Studies show that while the rates of cancer are about the same in Black women and White women, the likelihood of death for Black women is 19 percent higher than for White women (Monticciolo et al., 2019).</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_734" title="734"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Racial differences in mental health are far less well understood than are racial differences in physical health. Until recently, most studies have shown that Blacks report fewer symptoms of depression than do Whites, and once socioeconomic factors are controlled for, Blacks actually report lower rates of depression than Whites (Dunlop et al., 2003). While studies indicate that depression among Blacks was prevalent at 10.4 percent as compared to Whites at 17.9 percent, Blacks experienced chronic depression at a much higher rate than Whites (56 percent vs. 38.6 percent, respectively). While Blacks may have lower rates of depression then Whites (partially due to religious and community support as well as strong racial identity), they are often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (Bailey, Mokonogho, and Kumar, 2019; Oates and Goode, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In sum, racial differences in physical health have narrowed yet persisted over time, while differences in mental health can be explained by a range of psychosocial factors, underscoring the complex ways that biological, social, and economic factors shape health.</p>

<section id="gender-based-inequalities-in-health">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Gender-Based Inequalities in Health</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Women in the United States generally live longer than men—a relatively recent phenomenon. In the United States, there was only a two-year difference in female and male life expectancies in 1900. By 1940, this gap had increased to 4.4 years; by 1970, to 7.7 years. Today, the gender gap in life expectancy is just under 5 years; women’s life expectancy at birth is now 81 years, while men can expect to live 76 years (OECD, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The main reason for the gender gap in life expectancy is that the leading causes of death have changed since the turn of the century—and the main causes of death today disproportionately strike men. In 1900, the leading cause of death was infectious disease, which struck men, women, and children equally. However, emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 is distinct among infectious disease for disproportionately affecting men, although scientists do not fully understand why (Gupta, 2020). Chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer, which are the leading causes of death today, also disproportionately strike men. These conditions are heavily influenced by lifestyle, diet, and behavior—all of which are shaped by the distinctive experiences of women and men in contemporary society. The World Health Organization also notes that newborn girls are more likely to survive to their first birthday as compared to newborn boys. This inherent biological advantage continues through life and women are expected to live six to eight years more than men in many regions of the world (WHO, 2020a).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Social explanations for women’s mortality advantage focus on behavioral differences between men and women. Men historically have been socialized to equate risk with masculinity (Mahalik et al., 2007). Men are more likely than women to smoke cigarettes. Likewise, higher proportions of men drink alcoholic beverages, binge drink, and smoke marijuana (CDC, 2017a). However, in recent years, female high school dropouts have experienced a decrease in life expectancy, due to poor health behaviors such as smoking, drinking, and prescription drug misuse (Olshansky, Antonucci, and Berkman et al., 2012). As a result, the gender gap in life expectancy has narrowed for those with the least education, yet this change is due to declines in women’s health rather than improvement in men’s.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_735" title="735"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While sociologists generally focus on societal factors in explaining the gender gap in life expectancy, biological factors may also pertain. Disentangling the effects of biology from social context is very difficult, however, given that gender shapes one’s social experiences from the moment of birth (see <a href="part0065_split_000.html#1TVKI0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 10</a>). One study from the 1950s used an innovative design in its attempts to identify the distinctive effects of biology versus social environment on mortality risk. The researchers focused on a subpopulation of men and women who were believed to have identical lifestyles, diets, and levels of stress: nuns and monks (Madigan, 1957). The nuns lived longer than the monks, and both had life expectancies essentially the same as that for the rest of the population. Because the living environments were equalized for the two groups, lifestyle elements such as diet, drinking, and stress could be ruled out as explanatory factors (Madigan, 1957). However, critics noted that the monks smoked more than the nuns did, so the study did not entirely account for lifestyle differences. Further, the study could not account for the gender-related lifestyle factors that existed before persons entered the religious order.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Numerous studies spanning the fields of biology and epidemiology provide suggestive evidence that women have a biological advantage. Recent studies suggest that estrogen helps protect women against heart disease by reducing circulatory levels of harmful cholesterol, whereas testosterone increases low-density lipoprotein. Women also have stronger immune systems, in part because testosterone causes immunosuppression (Ness and Kuller, 1999). Emerging evidence also suggests that women with COVID-19 have a higher level of antibodies than men, which are a protective factor (Gupta, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Biologists have also cited genetic factors. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, one of which determines sex. Males have XY sex chromosomes, while females have two X chromosomes. The X chromosome carries more genetic information than the Y, including some defects that can lead to physical abnormalities. Instead of making females more vulnerable to X-linked disorders, this seems to give females a genetic advantage. A female typically needs two defective X chromosomes for most genetically linked disorders to manifest themselves; otherwise, one healthy X chromosome can override the abnormal one. A male who has a defective X chromosome will have a genetically linked disease because there is no other X chromosome to cancel it out. This fact may account for the higher numbers of miscarriages of male fetuses, male infant deaths, and deaths at all ages due to congenital abnormalities and weaker cardiopulmonary systems (Hayflick, 1994; Hill and Upchurch, 1995). However, biology alone cannot explain gender difference in mortality, especially because this relationship differs substantially over time and across nations.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the apparent ironies of health research is that women have an advantage in mortality, yet they appear to fare worse than men on nearly every indicator of self-reported health problems on surveys. For instance, women report higher rates of illness from acute conditions and nonfatal chronic conditions, including arthritis, osteoporosis, and depressive and anxiety disorders. Women are slightly more likely to report their health as fair to poor, they spend about 40 percent more days in bed each year, and their activities are restricted due to health problems about 25 percent more than are men’s. In addition, they make more physician visits each year and undergo twice the number of surgical procedures as do men (National Center for Health Statistics, 2008). Women also are twice as likely as men to report symptoms of depression <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_736" title="736"></span>and to be diagnosed with a major depressive disorder (Van de Velde, Bracke, and Leveque, 2010).</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">One of the explanations for women’s mortality advantage is that women engage in more preventive care.</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What would explain this paradox, that men die younger but women report more health problems? Sociologists offer two main explanations: (1) Advancing age brings poorer health, and women are older than men on average due to their greater life expectancy and (2) women make greater use of medical services, including preventive care, and thus are more cognizant of their health symptoms (National Center for Health Statistics, 2008). Men may experience as many, or more, health symptoms as women, but they may ignore their symptoms, underestimate the extent of their illness, or utilize preventive services less often (Waldron, 1986). Further, men who are socialized to believe that men should be “traditionally masculine,” strong, and self-sufficient are less likely to seek out annual checkups (Springer and Mouzon, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Explanations for the gender gap in depression are less clear, yet scholars typically attribute women’s greater level of depression to measurement issues and differences in stress exposure. First, standard instruments used to measure depression typically emphasize symptoms that are more likely to be endorsed by women, as these symptoms are more closely linked to stereotypical female behavior such as “I felt sad” or “I cried a lot” (Stommel et al., 1993). Men are less likely to endorse such items, leading some scholars to question whether depression in men goes underdetected. Second, given the strains that women increasingly face in juggling work and family roles, compounded by other stressors that disproportionately strike women, such as single parenthood or workplace discrimination, women may be more likely than men to be depleted and depressed by the daunting demands they face (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1993).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A major question for sociologists is whether the gender gap in life expectancy will continue to close in coming years. Many researchers believe that it will, yet for an unfortunate reason: Women’s life expectancies may erode and thus become more similar to men’s. As men’s and women’s gender roles have converged over the past several decades, women have increasingly taken on unhealthy “male-typed” behaviors such as smoking and alcohol use, as well as emotional and physical stress in the workplace. These patterns are particularly pronounced for women of low socioeconomic status. One recent study found that American women have lost ground with respect to life expectancy compared with women from other nations. In the early 1980s, the life expectancy of women in the United States ranked 14th in the world, yet by 2010, American women had fallen to 41st place (Karas-Montez and Zajacova, 2013). Currently, the United States is ranked last in life expectancy for both men and women in comparable large and wealthy countries (Kamal, 2017). These disheartening findings reveal that gender differences in health and mortality are not a function of biology <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_737" title="737"></span>alone but of the social advantages and adversities men and women experience in particular sociohistorical contexts.</p>
