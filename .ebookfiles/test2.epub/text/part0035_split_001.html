<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologist Erving Goffman and other writers on social interaction often use notions from theater in their analyses. The concept of the social role, for example, originated in a theatrical setting. Broadly speaking, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-roles" href="part0035_split_008.html#roles">roles</a><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_136" title="136"></span> are socially defined expectations that a person in a given <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-status" href="part0035_split_008.html#status">status</a> (or <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-position" href="part0035_split_008.html#social-position">social position</a>) follows. To be a teacher is to hold a specific position; the teacher’s role consists of acting in specified ways toward pupils. Goffman (1973) sees social life as played out by actors on a stage (or on many stages) because how we act depends on the roles we play at a given time.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">People are sensitive to how others see them and use many forms of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-impression-management" href="part0035_split_008.html#impression-management">impression management</a> to compel others to react to them in the ways they wish them to. Although we may sometimes do this in a calculated way, usually we do this without conscious attention. When going on a job interview, a person will typically dress more formally and try to put their best foot forward; however, when going out with friends, they might dress down, use slang, and act in ways that may not impress a prospective employer.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A central insight of social interaction based on Goffman’s work is that every human being possesses a self that is fragile and vulnerable to embarrassment, or even humiliation, at every turn. People are intensely attuned to what others think of them and how others view them. That’s part of the reason why we’re so careful about what we post on Facebook and why we cringe if we’re tagged by friends in unflattering or embarrassing photos. Seeking approval and respect, individuals want to “save face” at every turn. In social interactions, human beings tend to collaborate with others to make sure that the interaction ends without embarrassment for anyone. As a stage, social life has many players, and they must collaborate to make each scene work.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Think of examples from your own life when people did not collaborate with you. If you go to a club and someone with whom you don’t want to talk approaches you, you will likely try to end the interaction in a way that spares the other person embarrassment. If you were simply to tell the person, “Get lost!” rather than help him or her save face, that would be highly unusual. This is because there is a norm of collaboration by which human beings try to move through life without embarrassing or humiliating others. When this collaboration does not occur, the interaction stands out.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The pose that we adopt depends a great deal on our social role, but no particular role dictates any specific presentation of self. A person’s demeanor can be different depending on the social context. For instance, as a student, you have a certain status and are expected to act a certain way when you are around your professors. Some pupils will enact the self-presentation of the dutiful student, while others will assume an uncaring or apathetic pose. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_137" title="137"></span>Some sociological studies suggest that in poor inner-city schools whose student bodies comprise largely minorities, students afraid of being accused of “acting White” will adopt a personal style that is more “street” than studious. However, this appearance may not give an accurate sense of how capable a student really is. A student who takes on the demeanor of the street may be studying just as hard as classmates who take on the demeanor of the mild-mannered scholar.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Adopting Roles</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For an example of collaboration in impression management that also borrows from the theater, let’s look at one particular study in some detail. James Henslin and Mae Biggs (1971, 1997) studied a specific, highly delicate type of encounter: a woman’s visit to a gynecologist. At the time of the study, male doctors carried out most pelvic examinations, hence the experience was (and sometimes still is) fraught with potential ambiguities and embarrassment for both parties. Men and women in the West are socialized to think of the genitals as the most private part of the body, and seeing, and particularly touching, the genitals of another person is ordinarily associated with intimate sexual encounters. Some women feel so worried by the prospect of a pelvic examination that they refuse to visit the doctor, male or female, even when they suspect there is a strong medical reason to do so.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Henslin and Biggs analyzed material collected by Biggs, a trained nurse, from a large number of gynecological examinations. They interpreted what they found as occurring in several typical stages. Adopting a dramaturgical metaphor, they suggested that each phase could be treated as a distinct scene, in which the parts the actors play alter as the episode unfolds. In the prologue, the woman enters the waiting room preparing to assume the role of patient and temporarily discarding her outside identity. Called into the consulting room, she adopts the “patient” role, and the first scene opens. The doctor assumes a businesslike, professional manner and treats the patient as a proper and competent person, maintaining eye contact and listening politely to what she has to say. If the doctor decides an examination is called for, he tells her so and leaves the room. Scene One is over.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As the doctor leaves, a female nurse comes in. She is an important stagehand in the main scene shortly to begin. She soothes any worries the patient might have, acting as both a confidante—knowing some of the “things women have to put up with”—and a collaborator in what is to follow. Crucial to the next scene, the nurse helps alter the patient from a person to a “nonperson” for the vital scene—which features a body, part of which is to be scrutinized, rather than a complete human being. In Henslin and Biggs’s study, the nurse supervises the patient’s undressing, taking the patient’s clothes and folding them. Most women want their underwear to be out of sight when the doctor returns, so the nurse makes sure that this is so. She guides the patient to the examining table and covers most of the patient’s body with a sheet before the physician returns.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The central scene now opens, with the nurse as well as the doctor taking part. The presence of the nurse helps ensure that the interaction between the doctor and the patient is free of sexual overtones and provides a legal witness should the physician be charged with unprofessional conduct. The examination proceeds as though the patient’s personality were absent; the sheet across her separates the genital area from <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_138" title="138"></span>the rest of her body, and her position does not allow her to watch the examination itself. Save for any specific medical queries, the doctor ignores her, sitting on a low stool out of her line of vision. The patient collaborates in becoming a temporary nonperson, not initiating conversation and keeping any movements to a minimum.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the interval between this scene and the final one, the nurse again plays the role of stagehand, helping the patient become a full person once more. After the doctor has left the room, the two may again engage in conversation, the patient expressing relief that the examination is over. Having dressed and groomed herself, the patient is ready to face the concluding scene. The doctor reenters and, in discussing the results of the examination, again treats the patient as a complete person. Resuming his polite, professional manner, he conveys that his reactions to her are in no way altered by the intimate contact with her body. The epilogue is played out when the patient leaves the physician’s office, resuming her identity in the outside world. The patient and the doctor have thus collaborated in such a way as to manage the interaction and the impression each participant forms of the other.</p>
