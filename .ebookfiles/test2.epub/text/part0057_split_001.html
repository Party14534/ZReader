<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 1955, the Nobel Prize–winning economist Simon Kuznets proposed a hypothesis that came to be widely accepted: the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-kuznets-curve" href="part0057_split_005.html#kuznets-curve">Kuznets curve</a>, a formula showing that inequality increases during the early stages of capitalist development, then declines, and eventually stabilizes at a relatively low level (Figure 8.5). Studies of European countries, the United States, and Canada all suggested that inequality peaked in these places before World War II, declined through the 1950s, and remained roughly the same through the 1970s (Berger, 1986; Nielsen, 1994). In the post–World War II era, inequality declined in part due to economic expansion in industrial societies, which created opportunities for people at the bottom to move up, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_274" title="274"></span>and in part to government health insurance, welfare, and other programs aimed at reducing inequality.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Was Kuznets’s prediction correct? Have we seen stabilization in levels of inequality? There is evidence that some capitalist economies have entered a fourth phase, one in which inequality is again increasing. In the United States, for example, during the past 30 years, the rich have gotten much richer, middle-class incomes have stagnated, and the poor have grown in number and are poorer than they have been since the 1960s. The gap between rich and poor is the largest since 1947, when the Census Bureau started measuring it, and the largest in the industrial world. Among industrialized countries, the United States has one of the most unequal distributions of household income (Denmark had the most equal; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2014a). In 2015, the top 5 percent of households in the United States received 23.1 percent of total income, the highest 20 percent obtained 52 percent, while the bottom 20 percent received only slightly more than 3 percent (Figure 8.6) (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2019c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most people are aware that the gap between rich Americans and all others has increased significantly since the 2008 recession. But the gap had been widening long before the recession. The reasons for this increase are many and debated, but globalization (whose role we consider in the next chapter) and the declining role of governments (discussed in <a href="part0083_split_000.html#2F4UM0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 13</a>) are likely two factors that have led to rising inequality not only in the United States and Europe but also in much of the world.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another indication of growing inequality (again, long before the recession) was the growing earnings gap between top corporate officials and average working Americans. In 2013, the CEOs of companies listed on the Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P) stock index earned, on average, $11.7 million, 331 times the average worker compensation of $35,200. Thirty years ago, the S&amp;P CEOs earned only 46 times as much as the average worker (Wong, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The ideas behind the Kuznets curve may have held true for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but whether it will hold true for the twenty-first century remains an open question.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Thomas Piketty: “Capital in the Twenty-First Century”</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The most influential book on social stratification to appear in many years was written not by an American sociologist but by a French economist. Published in 2013, Thomas Piketty’s book <i class="italic">Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i> (the title is intended to suggest an updating of Karl Marx’s book by the same title, written nearly 150 years ago) examines changes in the sources and concentration of wealth in capitalist economies since the Industrial Revolution some two and a half centuries ago.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although his book is long (700 pages), dense, and full of dozens of complicated tables and graphs, Piketty’s conclusions can be stated simply: Unless an economy is growing rapidly—for example, because of technological breakthroughs or rapid <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_276" title="276"></span>population growth—increases in wealth will exceed economic growth. This situation, he shows, will inevitably result in a concentration of wealth—especially inherited wealth—and therefore growing inequality. Ever-increasing wealth inequality is therefore not an accident but rather an inevitable feature of almost all capitalist economic systems.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Piketty shows that this has been the case in most developed economies, with one major exception: the mid-twentieth century. During the period that included two world wars and the Great Depression, government policies (such as Roosevelt’s New Deal), followed by periods of rapid economic growth, briefly reduced wealth inequality. But he argues that this reduction was an exception, and, in fact, we have once again entered a period of growing inequality. In the United States, for example, he shows that 60 percent of the increase in income in the past 30 years has gone to the richest 1 percent—a situation he calls “patrimonial capitalism” (“patrimonial” refers to a system in which power is concentrated in the hands of a few). This situation is of concern, he argues, because it is both politically untenable and economically unstable. To avoid a future crisis, he calls for a global tax on wealth.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Piketty’s argument has been well received by sociologists since it provides an explanation for growing inequality that is supported by data and has the broad historical sweep of Marx and Weber.</p>
