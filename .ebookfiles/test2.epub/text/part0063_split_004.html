<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">What Does Rapid Globalization Mean for the Future of Global Inequality?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, the social and economic forces leading to a single global capitalist economy appear to be irreversible. State-driven socialism, which was the principal challenge to this outcome, came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many future scenarios are possible. In one, our world might be dominated by large global corporations, with falling wages for many people in high-income countries and rising wages for a few in low-income countries (see again Robinson, 2004, 2014, 2019; Sklair, 2000). Average income worldwide might level out, although at a level much lower than that currently enjoyed in the United States and other industrialized nations. In this scenario, the polarization between the haves and the have-nots within countries would grow, as the whole world would be divided into those who benefit from the global economy and those who do not. Such polarization could fuel conflict among ethnic groups, and even among nations, if those suffering from economic globalization blame others for their plight.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In another, more hopeful scenario, a global economy could mean greater opportunity for everyone as the benefits of modern technology stimulate worldwide economic growth. The republics of the former Soviet Union and the formerly socialist countries of Eastern Europe will eventually become high-income countries. Economic growth will spread to Latin America, Africa, and the rest of the world. Because capitalism requires that workers be mobile, the remaining caste societies will be replaced by class-based societies, which will experience enhanced opportunities for upward mobility. Indeed, the most successful countries in Asia and South America might be a sign of things to come. China and India, the world’s two most populous countries, together have middle-class populations totaling as many as several hundred million people, while Brazil, the world’s fifth most populous country, is also growing rapidly. Of course, the global environmental impacts of such a scenario could be catastrophic (see <a href="part0121_split_000.html#3JCK20-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What is the future of global inequality? It is difficult to be entirely optimistic. Global economic growth has slowed, and while environmental challenges resulting from global warming will affect all countries, the poorest countries will be the hardest hit. The Russian economy, in its move from state-driven socialism to capitalism, has encountered many pitfalls, leaving many Russians poorer than ever. The European Union (EU), once thought to be a pillar of the global economy, is facing numerous challenges. While many countries have experienced economic growth, many have not; the gap between rich and poor remains large—and within many countries, this gap is growing.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The world is experiencing a significant pushback against what many see as the destructive effects of globalization. In June 2016, British voters narrowly approved <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_318" title="318"></span>“Brexit,” a referendum on leaving the EU. Although it took an additional three years of often contentious parliamentary debate to decide how best to manage this radical change (or, indeed, whether to rethink leaving entirely), Britain and the EU officially parted company on February 1, 2020. The decision to leave the EU was driven in large part by concerns among many working- and middle-class voters that EU membership was hurting them economically, opening Britain’s borders to immigrants who were seen as competing for jobs and, for some voters, as culturally “different” and therefore threatening. The EU, whose 28 members make it the world’s second-largest economy (the United States is the largest), had been widely regarded as a reasonably successful example of globalization—a trading bloc whose open borders permitted businesses and workers alike to move freely for mutual benefit. Brexit made it clear that such benefits were not universally shared.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Brexit was but one example of how globalization is being challenged throughout the world. In countries as diverse as Turkey, China, Russia, India, Hungary, Poland, the Philippines, and even the United States, populist leaders have emerged whose appeal is strongest among those who believe they have been damaged by globalization. The emergence of far-right nationalist parties throughout Europe, many of which have achieved electoral success in recent years, suggests that Britain may not be the only country to consider such an action. In March 2018, the party that received the largest number of votes in Italy’s national elections was the Five Star Party, a youthful party that is strongly environmentalist, populist, critical of what it sees as the destructive aspects of globalization, and skeptical of the EU. Strongly nationalist parties also earned a large percentage of the votes, leading observers to conclude that the elections may result in Italy also rethinking its relationship to the EU (Monti, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A survey of nearly 50,000 respondents in 44 countries found significant differences between those who lived in advanced economies and those who lived in developing ones in the perceived benefits of trade. When asked whether or not trade creates jobs, only 20 percent of respondents in the United States answered yes, while fully half believed that trade destroyed jobs. Among respondents in all advanced economies, only 44 percent believed trade created jobs, in comparison with 66 percent of those in developing economies (Pew Research Center, 2014f). There is clearly a widely shared belief that globalization has shifted jobs from more economically developed (higher-wage) countries to less economically developed (lower-wage) ones, with growing <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_319" title="319"></span>inequality one result. But are such perceptions correct? Is globalization the principal cause of job loss and growing inequality in the United States?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A growing body of research suggests that the answer to this question is no. One highly cited study found that even though the demand for goods manufactured in the United States has increased in recent years, the number of workers required to produce those goods has plummeted, the result of technological changes that have greatly increased worker productivity. By analyzing employment, trade, and productivity in all U.S. manufacturing jobs over the first decade of the twenty-first century, the study concluded that 88 percent of 6.5 million lost manufacturing jobs resulted from productivity increases rather than globalization. Thanks to technological advances, it simply takes fewer workers to manufacture the goods we all consume (Hicks and Devaraj, 2015).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Robotics—machines powered by information technology and artificial intelligence—are beginning to revolutionize production in the United States and around the globe. While China is often faulted for “stealing” American jobs, most of the U.S. jobs that have disappeared are now being performed digitally, from electronic cash registers that scan your purchases to automobile factories where huge computer-driven robotic arms perform welding and assembly. Three-dimensional printing, visual and voice recognition, and advances in information technology are rapidly claiming jobs that once led to a middle-class lifestyle; growing inequality is one result (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Nor is this process limited to advanced industrial countries like the United States, where workers once enjoyed relatively high wages. China’s giant Foxconn factories, where worker suicides created a public outcry, are beginning to replace human labor with robots as well. In 2015, Foxconn CEO Terry Gou announced plans to introduce a million robots (dubbed “Foxbots”), replacing workers who engage in such tasks as spraying, welding, and assembling. Some 60,000 workers had reportedly been replaced by 2016 (Fox, 2015; Wakefield, 2016). Gou himself was heard to comment, on a visit to a zoo in Taiwan, that Foxconn “has a workforce of over one million worldwide, and as human beings are also animals, to manage one million animals gives me a headache” (reported in Kwong, 2012). Robots require less management than human workers, and they are not prone to committing suicide when overworked. Even in China, where wages are still far below wages in the United States, machines now perform many routine operations more cheaply than people could.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The pushback against globalization will not slow the technological revolution that is reshaping work and contributing to inequality. The future of global inequality remains an open question—one whose answer will depend, in large part, on whether globalization can be managed more equitably, and whether new jobs can be found for those displaced by technological innovation.</p>
