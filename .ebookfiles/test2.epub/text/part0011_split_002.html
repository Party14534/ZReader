<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although Comte, Durkheim, Marx, and Weber are foundational figures in sociology, other thinkers from the same period made important contributions. Very few women <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_16" title="16"></span>or members of racial minorities had the opportunity to become professional sociologists during the “classical” period of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Even the foundational figures in sociology frequently ignored women and racial minorities, at the same time that they were creating the first theories to systematically address inequality, stratification, subjective meaning, and exploitation. As a result, the few women and members of racial minorities who conducted sociological research of lasting importance often remain neglected by the field. These individuals and the theories they developed deserve the attention of sociologists today.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Harriet Martineau (1802–1876), born and educated in England, has been called the “first woman sociologist.” As with Marx and Weber, her interests extended beyond sociology. She was the author of more than 50 books, as well as numerous essays, and was an active proponent of women’s rights and the abolition of slavery. Martineau is now credited with introducing sociology to England through her translation of Comte’s founding treatise of the field, <i class="italic">Positive Philosophy</i> (Rossi, 1973). Additionally, she conducted a systematic study of American society during her extensive travels throughout the United States in the 1830s, which is the subject of her book <i class="italic">Society in America</i> (1962; orig. 1837).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Martineau is significant to sociologists today for several reasons but in particular for her methodological insight. First, she <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_17" title="17"></span>argued that when one studies a society, one must focus on all its aspects, including key political, religious, and social institutions. Second, she insisted that an analysis of a society must include all its members, a point that drew attention to the conspicuous absence of women’s lives from the sociology of that time. Third, she was the first to turn a sociological eye on previously ignored issues and institutions, including marriage, children, domestic and religious life, and race relations. Finally, like Comte, she argued that sociologists should do more than just observe; they should also act in ways that benefit society.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">W. E. B. Du Bois</h3>
<figure class="figure--fullwidth" data-figure-id="ch01ph11"><a data-href="../images/Ch01ph11.jpg" tabindex="0" data-size="532x638"><img class="figure__image" alt="" src="../images/00013.jpeg" data-image-id="ch01ph11"/></a>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">W. E. B. Du Bois (1868–1963) was the first African American to earn a doctorate from Harvard University. Among his many contributions to sociology, perhaps most important is the concept of “double consciousness,” a way of talking about identity through the lens of the experiences of African Americans (Morris, 2015). He argued that American society lets African Americans see themselves only through the eyes of others: “It is a particular sensation, this double consciousness, this sense of always measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness—an American, a Negro, two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings, two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder” (1903). Du Bois made a persuasive claim that one’s sense of self and one’s identity are greatly influenced by historical experiences and social circumstances—in the case of African Americans, the effect of slavery, and, after emancipation, segregation and prejudice.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Throughout his career, Du Bois focused on race relations in the United States; as he said in an oft-repeated quote, “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line” (Du Bois, 1903). His influence on sociology today is evidenced by continued interest in the questions he raised, particularly his concern that sociology must explain “the contact of diverse races of men” (Du Bois, 1903). Du Bois was also the first social researcher to trace the problems faced by African Americans to their social and economic underpinnings, a connection that most sociologists now widely accept. Finally, he connected social analysis to social reform. He was one of the founding members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and a longtime advocate for the collective struggle of African Americans.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Later in his life, Du Bois became disenchanted by the lack of progress in American race relations. He moved to the African nation of Ghana in 1961 when he was invited by the nation’s president, Kwame Nkrumah, to direct the <i class="italic">Encyclopedia Africana,</i> a government publication in which Du Bois had long had an interest. He died in Ghana in 1963. Although Du Bois receded from American life in his later years, his impact on American social thought and activism has been particularly profound, with many ideas of the Black Lives Matter movement informed by his writings (Morris, 2015).</p>
