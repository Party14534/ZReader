<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Norms and Sanctions</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We most often follow social norms because, as a result of socialization, we are used to doing so. Individuals become committed to social norms through interactions with people who obey the law. Through these interactions, we learn self-control. The more numerous these interactions, the fewer opportunities we have to deviate from conventional norms. Over time, the longer we interact in conventional ways, the more we stand to lose by not conforming (Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">All social norms carry <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-sanction" href="part0047_split_003.html#sanction">sanctions</a> that promote conformity and protect against nonconformity. A sanction is any reaction from others that is meant to ensure that a person or group complies with a given norm. Sanctions may be positive (the offering of rewards for conformity) or negative (punishment for behavior that does not conform). They can also be formal or informal. Formal sanctions are applied by a specific group or agency to ensure that a particular set of norms is followed. Informal sanctions are less organized and more spontaneous reactions to nonconformity, such as when a student’s friends teasingly accuse him <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_202" title="202"></span>of working too hard or being a nerd if he spends an evening studying rather than going to a party.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Courts and prisons represent the main types of formal sanctions in modern societies. The police are charged with bringing offenders to trial and possibly to imprisonment. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-laws" href="part0047_split_003.html#laws">Laws</a> are norms defined by governments as principles their citizens must follow; sanctions are used against people who do not conform to those principles. Where there are laws, there are also crimes because <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-crime" href="part0047_split_003.html#crime">crime</a> constitutes any type of behavior that breaks a law.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is important to recognize, however, that the law is only a guide to a society’s norms.</p>
