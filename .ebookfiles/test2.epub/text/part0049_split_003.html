<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Like its mass incarceration rates, the United States’ use of capital punishment (the death penalty) makes the country an unusual case compared to other liberal democratic nations. Support for capital punishment is high in the United States, though it has been steadily declining since peaking in the mid-1990s. In 2018, approximately 54 percent of adults surveyed said they favored the death penalty for people convicted of murder; 39 percent opposed it (Oliphant, 2019). This represents a significant shift from 1994, when 80 percent of those surveyed supported the death penalty and only 16 percent were opposed to it. Nevertheless, American support of capital punishment is unusual in an international political climate that has increasingly condemned the use of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In <i class="italic">Peculiar Institution: America’s Death Penalty in an Age of Abolition</i>, David Garland (2010) discusses the political institutions and historical processes that explain the continuing <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_215" title="215"></span>use of the death penalty in the United States. While use of capital punishment declined from the 1940s to mid-1970s (by which time the United States had almost a decade without any executions), use of capital punishment has since increased. Today, between 20 and 40 executions are authorized annually; in 2018, 25 prisoners were executed (Death Penalty Information Center, 2018). From the 1770s to 1970s, the United States followed the example of many other Western nations, permitting capital punishment but steadily reducing its usage. Yet, today, it remains one of the last Western countries legally to permit the practice, and it relies upon capital punishment frequently to penalize violent criminals—a practice many other countries find hard to understand. What accounts for the persistence of the death penalty in the United States?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some scholars have argued that something exceptional about American culture has allowed the death penalty to remain in place, despite abolition in other countries. However, Garland argues against this view. Rather, American “deviance” from an international trend toward abolishing the death penalty is better understood by looking at the specific historical circumstances, institutions, and social processes that produced this current state of affairs. In particular, Garland argues that three features of the American political system at the federal and state level—“the state’s relative autonomy from the national state, the local control of the power to punish, [and] the political dominance of small groups”—explain the historical development of capital punishment in America. Though the Supreme Court had a number of opportunities to overturn the death penalty, concern for the separation of powers and “deference to shifting public sentiment” (Garland, 2010) has discouraged the court from ruling on behalf of the people.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While Garland’s nuanced argument relates also to the emergence of liberalism and currents of humanitarian and democratic thought in Western nations, he suggests that the masses are generally in support of the death penalty, while elites will move to <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_216" title="216"></span>overturn it. In Western nations that have abolished the death penalty, governing elites like judges and legislators made the decision to abolish the death penalty—with or without the support of their citizens. By contrast, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly left the question of capital punishment to the state courts. This unique feature of the American political system, rather than some essential feature of American culture, best accounts for the continued legality of the death penalty in the United States.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As a result of the way the U.S. legal system treats the most deviant of its criminals, the United States is regarded as a deviant nation on the international stage. However, Garland shows that this apparent deviance is actually a function of specific historical and political processes. By taking a historical and sociological approach to law, we see how the study of deviance can be applied even beyond individuals.</p>
