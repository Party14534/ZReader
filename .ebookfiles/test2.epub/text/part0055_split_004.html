<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">Erik Olin Wright: Contradictory Class Locations</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The career of the American sociologist Erik Olin Wright illustrates some of the most important changes in the U.S. class structure and system of inequality over the past half century. Influenced by the classical theories of Karl Marx, Wright was central to the creation of a group of scholars known as “no bullshit Marxists” who were interested in using empirical—largely quantitative—evidence to assess Marx’s ideas in light of the times in which research was taking place.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the 1980s, Wright was the first to recognize that the massive expansion of the middle class in American society posed a problem for Marx’s theories because Marx viewed the class structure through the simple lens of owners and workers. Wright did not believe that middle-class people—and particularly the upper middle classes—could be understood using that classification. He argued, for example, that upper-middle-class people such as managers controlled the working class while being simultaneously controlled by capitalist owners. In other words, these managers were essentially exploiting others while also being exploited.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This was a position that owed much to Marx but also incorporated ideas from Weber. According to Wright, there are three dimensions of control over economic resources in modern capitalist production, and these allow us to identify the major classes:</p>
<ol class="fmnl">
<li class="bcpt" value="1">Control over investments or money capital</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="2">Control over the physical means of production (land or factories and offices)</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="3">Control over labor power</li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Members of the capitalist class have control over all of these dimensions of the production system. Members of the working class have control over none of them. Between these two main classes, however, are the groups whose position is more ambiguous: managers and white-collar workers. These people are in what Wright calls <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-contradictory-class-locations" href="part0055_split_005.html#contradictory-class-locations">contradictory class locations</a>, because they can influence some aspects of production but lack control over others. White-collar and professional employees, for example, must contract their labor power to employers to <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_254" title="254"></span>make a living, in the same way manual workers do. Yet they have a greater degree of control over the work setting than do most people in blue-collar jobs. Wright terms the class position of such workers “contradictory” because they are neither capitalists nor manual workers, yet they share certain common features with each.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A large segment of the population—85 to 90 percent, according to Wright (1997)—falls into the category of those who must sell their labor because they do not control the means of production. Yet within this population is a great deal of diversity, ranging from the traditional manual working class to white-collar workers. To differentiate class locations within this large population, Wright considers two factors: the relationship to authority and the possession of skills or expertise. First, many middle-class workers, such as managers and supervisors, enjoy relationships to authority that are more privileged than those of the working class. Such individuals assist capitalists in controlling the working class by monitoring the work of other employees, for example, or by conducting personnel reviews and evaluations, and are rewarded by earning higher wages and receiving regular promotions. Yet these individuals remain under the control of the capitalist owners. In other words, they are both exploiters and the exploited.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The second factor that differentiates class locations within the middle classes is the possession of skills and expertise. According to Wright, middle-class employees possessing skills that are in demand in the labor market have a specific form of power in the capitalist system: They can earn a higher wage. The lucrative positions available to information technology (IT) specialists in the knowledge economy illustrate this point. Moreover, Wright argues, because employees with knowledge and skills are more difficult to monitor and control, employers secure their loyalty and cooperation by rewarding them accordingly.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Wright’s ideas were central to carrying on the Marxist tradition through much of the past half century. Yet, toward the end of his life, he came to believe that a focus on the middle classes no longer was as important for Marxists. In an interview for this textbook, Wright said, “If I were to write a fifty-page text on how to think about class in the twenty-first century, I would begin by saying the problem of class is not the problem of the poor, the working class or the middle class. It’s the problem of the ruling class—of a capitalist class that’s so immensely wealthy that they are capable of destroying the world as a side effect of their private pursuit of gain.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Thus, in Wright’s final studies, instead of focusing on the middle classes, he studied the democratization of the economy and the ruling class. His last book, published a few months after he passed away, was called <i class="italic">How to Be an Anticapitalist in the Twenty-First Century</i>.</p>
