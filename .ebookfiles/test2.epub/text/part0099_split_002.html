<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">“Reality” TV shows like “Married at First Sight” and “90 Day Fiance” would have us believe that people jump into marriage shortly after meeting, perhaps after a brief and passionate whirlwind romance. Yet most couples take the leap into cohabitation or marriage after a lengthy period of dating or courtship, in which they get to know each other before committing to a lifetime together. Courtship might include activities like dating where couples or groups get together for shared activities like dinner, movies, parties, or <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_578" title="578"></span>sporting events. But dating is more than just recreation; this is the process through which romantic partners learn about each other’s personalities, values, goals, and foibles, and become acquainted with their partners’ family members who may eventually become in-laws (Weigel, 2017). Modern romantic relationships can begin and develop without face-to-face contact, thanks to apps like Tinder and Bumble, which allow singles to find a partner whom they find attractive without having to rely on traditional means like parties, bars, or blind dates. Virtual dating, sending text messages, instant messaging, writing emails, or video-chatting through Skype or FaceTime are modern ways that partners use to get to know each other (Rosenfeld, 2018). Online dating and even online dates became the only option for young singles when stay-at-home orders were in place during the 2020 pandemic (Vinopal, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Dating and courtship are taken-for-granted experiences for young people today, but the romantic notion of choosing one’s own life partner based on physical attraction, personality compatibility, and the feeling of having found one’s “soulmate” is a very modern and Western phenomenon (Weigel, 2017). Arranged marriages were the norm in most parts of the world until the eighteenth century and largely disappeared from Western industrialized nations as the values of individualism and personal autonomy flourished (Coontz, 2006). However, arranged unions are still the norm in many parts of the world, especially South Asia. Family members, typically one’s parents, select the young person’s romantic partner, occasionally with the assistance of a professional matchmaker. The reasons for arranged marriage vary across time and place, but some of the most common reasons are wealth and inheritance concerns, cultural or religious tradition, and ensuring that one’s child marries a person of their own ethnic, racial, or religious group.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Scholars have asked the important question of whether arranged versus autonomous (“love”) marriages are more successful, and they do not have definitive answers. The evidence generally shows that in arranged marriages, love and friendship can emerge over time, and that autonomous marriages have no guarantee that the love and romance will persist—as evidenced by high rates of divorce in wealthy Western nations. In other words, there’s no guarantee that any type of romantic union will be happy and harmonious forever, regardless of one’s pathway into that union (Epstein, Pandit, and Thakar, 2013). Feminist scholars have also pointed out that young women manage to exert some choice and creatively navigate the process of arranged meetings with potential spouses (Pande, 2015).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Even in the contemporary United States, the ways that young people meet and interact with romantic partners has shifted dramatically over the past century. It was only in the early twentieth century that dating emerged as a “fun” activity that was considered a normal stage of adolescence and early adulthood. However, dating in the 1920s and 1930s was more chaste than it is today; premarital sex was frowned upon so couples progressed very quickly from dating to marriage. Following the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, premarital sex became more widely accepted, so dating couples could enjoy sexual relationships without rushing into marriage as a way to consummate their relationship (Coontz, 2006). In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, young people may “hook up” with a sexual partner or “hang out” with large groups of friends rather than go on traditional “dates” like dinner and a movie (Garcia et al., 2012). Although some scholars and conservative pundits have argued that casual sexual relationships or “hookups” are demeaning and demoralizing <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_579" title="579"></span>to young people (especially heterosexual women), other researchers suggest that these relationships allow young people to focus on their career goals, without concerns that they will be tied down by a partner (Armstrong and Hamilton, 2015). Moreover, “hook up” or “friends with benefits” relationships often do progress into more long-lasting unions. One study found that fully half of all college students’ committed dating relationships began as a “hookup” (Bogle, 2007).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">An additional consequence of rising levels of individualism over the past century is that young people feel less constrained to date partners who share the same ethnic, racial, or religious background as their parents or grandparents. Adolescents and young adults also are more likely than past generations to try same-sex dating; one recent study of 24,000 college students found that 25 percent of women and 12 percent of men who identified as “heterosexual” had their most recent hook-up with a partner of the same-sex (Kuperberg and Walker, 2018). However, sociologists are careful to point out that young people’s latitude in choosing whom to date is shaped by social context, such that LGBTQ youth are more comfortable “coming out” and dating same-sex partners in schools with more accepting climates and fewer practices that uphold heteronormativity, like a strong “football culture” (Wilkinson and Pearson, 2009).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Similarly, interracial dating is more common in schools that are racially and ethnically diverse (Kao, Joyner, and Ballisteri, 2019). Kao and colleagues (2019) analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a survey of more than 15,000 middle and high school students in the mid-1990s and tracked them over the next 15 years. They concluded that “giving young people the opportunity to interact with individuals of different races is essential to promoting interracial friendships and romantic relationships. A lot of sociologists … believe that individual characteristics—education, income level, etc.—make people more likely to have interracial … romances, but we found that the positive association of simply attending a diverse school outweighs those other factors” (Cummings, 2019). Taken together, these studies powerfully show that our dating lives, something we think of as being guided solely by our own romantic tastes, are highly structured by the environments in which we live and interact.</p>
