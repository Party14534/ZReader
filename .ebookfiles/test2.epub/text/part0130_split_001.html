<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Factors Contributing to Globalization</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although globalization is often portrayed solely as an economic phenomenon, it is in fact created by the coming together of technological, political, and economic factors. It has been driven above all by the development of information and communications technologies that have intensified the speed and scope of interaction among people worldwide.</p>
<section id="information-flows">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Information Flows</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Important advances in technology and the world’s telecommunications infrastructure have facilitated the explosion in global communications. The post–World War II era has seen a transformation in the scope and intensity of telecommunications flows. Traditional telephone communication, which depended on analog signals sent through wires and cables, has been replaced by integrated systems in which vast amounts of information are compressed and transferred digitally. Cable technology has become more efficient and less expensive. The development of fiber-optic cables, for example, has dramatically expanded the number of channels that can be carried, and even this recent technology has achieved significant advances. The spread of communications satellites has also helped expand international communications. As of 2019, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs stated that there were 4,987 satellites revolving around the earth (Chaturvedi, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The effect of these communications systems has been staggering. In countries with highly developed telecommunications infrastructures, homes and offices have multiple <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_831" title="831"></span>links to the outside world, including telephones (both land lines and cell phones), digital and cable television, and the Internet. The Internet is the fastest-growing communication tool ever developed. More than 4.1 billion people worldwide (over half of the world’s population) were estimated to be using the Internet at the end of 2019, representing more than 273 percent growth in usage since 2005 (International Telecommunication Union, 2020).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These forms of technology facilitate the compression of time and space: Two individuals located on opposite sides of the planet can not only hold a conversation in real time, they can send documents and images or tweet their ideas to each other with the help of satellite technology. Widespread use of the Internet and smartphones is accelerating processes of globalization; more people are becoming interconnected through these technologies in places that have previously been isolated or poorly served by traditional communications. Although the telecommunications infrastructure is not evenly developed around the world, a growing number of countries now have access to international communications networks.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Globalization is also being driven forward by the electronic integration of the world economy. The global economy increasingly involves activity that is weightless and intangible (Quah, 1999), because so many products have their base in information, as with computer software, media and entertainment products, and Internet-based services. A variety of new terms describe this new social order, such as <i class="italic">information society</i>, <i class="italic">service society</i>, and <i class="italic">knowledge society</i>. The emergence of this “knowledge society” reflects a broad base of consumers who are technologically literate and who eagerly integrate new advances in computing, entertainment, and telecommunications into their everyday lives.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_832" title="832"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The very operation of the global economy reflects the changes characteristic of the information age. Many aspects of the economy now require networks that cross national boundaries (Castells, 1996). To be competitive in globalizing conditions, businesses and corporations have become more flexible and less hierarchical. Production practices and organizational patterns have become more flexible, partnering arrangements with other firms have become commonplace, and participation in worldwide distribution networks has become essential.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Whether a job is in a factory or a call center, it can be done more cheaply in China, India, or some other country in the global south. The same is true for software engineering, graphic design, and financial advice. Of course, to the extent that global competition for labor reduces the cost of goods and services, it also provides for a wealth of cheaper products (Roach, 2005). As consumers, we all benefit from low-cost flat-panel TVs made in China or inexpensive computer games programmed in India. It is an open question, however, whether the declining cost of consumption will balance out wage and job losses due to globalization.</p>

<section id="political-changes">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Political Changes</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Political changes are driving forces behind contemporary globalization. One of the most significant was the collapse of Soviet-style communism, which occurred in Eastern Europe in 1989 and in the Soviet Union itself in 1991. Since then, countries in the former Soviet bloc—including Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Baltic states, and the states of the Caucasus and Central Asia—have been moving toward Western-style political and economic systems and are increasingly integrated into the global community. In fact, the collapse of communism not only hastened processes of globalization but also was a result of it. The centrally planned Communist economies and the ideological and cultural control of Communist political authority ultimately could not survive in an era of global media and an electronically integrated world economy.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">The proliferation of smartphones is accelerating the process of globalization.</figcaption>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A second political factor leading to intensifying globalization is the growth of international and regional mechanisms of government. The UN and the EU are two prominent examples of international organizations that bring together nation-states into a common political forum. Whereas the UN does this as an association of individual nation-states, the EU is a form of transnational governance in which member states relinquish some national sovereignty. The governments of EU states are bound by directives, regulations, and court judgments from common EU bodies, but they also reap <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_833" title="833"></span>economic, social, and political benefits from their participation in the regional union.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet both the UN and the EU have been challenged in recent years. The UN, unfortunately, has proven to be a weak actor. One of the reasons is that significant UN actions require the consent of its Security Council, which in turn requires the agreement of at least 9 of its 15 members, including all 5 of its permanent members (the United States, France, England, Russia, and China). Another reason is that member nations are not willing to give up their sovereignty to the UN, which consequently lacks the means to enforce its actions. The EU has had difficulty managing the economic slowdown of its member nations, including the near-insolvency of debt-ridden countries such as Greece. The influx of refugees from war-torn Syria and other countries has created seemingly insurmountable challenges, particularly since once they are in any European country, migrants can freely cross borders into any other. Antimigrant sentiments have grown, leading some to question the “open borders” policies that have thus far created a strongly unified Europe.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One result was the so-called “Brexit” vote in Britain, a June 2016 referendum in which slightly more than half of all voters (52 percent) called for Britain to withdraw from the EU. The vote passed because of voters’ concerns about immigration and the belief that Britain was surrendering too much national sovereignty to the EU governance system in Brussels. While opponents of Brexit argued that such concerns were greatly overblown, they could not assuage the fears of a majority of voters. The Brexit vote sent shock waves throughout the EU, since it raised fears that other countries may eventually follow suit.</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A third political factor is the growing importance of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-international-governmental-organizations-igos-" href="part0130_split_005.html#international-governmental-organizations-igos-">international governmental organizations (IGOs)</a> and <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-international-nongovernmental-organizations" href="part0130_split_005.html#international-nongovernmental-organizations">international nongovernmental organizations</a> (<a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-ingos" href="part0130_split_005.html#ingos">INGOs</a>; see also <a href="part0040_split_000.html#164MG0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 6</a>). An international governmental organization is a body that is established by participating governments and given responsibility for regulating or overseeing a domain of activity that is transnational in scope. Such bodies regulate issues ranging from civil aviation to broadcasting to the disposal of hazardous waste. In 1909, 37 IGOs were in existence to regulate transnational affairs; by 2005, there were more than 7,000 (Union of International Associations, 2005). Prominent examples <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_834" title="834"></span>include the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, and the UN.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">INGOs differ from IGOs in that they are not affiliated with government institutions. Rather, they are independent organizations that work alongside governmental bodies in making policy decisions and addressing international issues. Some of the best-known INGOs—such as Greenpeace, Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), the International Committee of the Red Cross, and Amnesty International—are involved in environmental protection and humanitarian relief efforts. But the activities of the nearly 40,000 lesser-known groups also link countries and communities (United States Institute of Peace, 2013).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Finally, the spread of information technology has expanded the possibilities for contact among people worldwide, while also facilitating the flow of information about people and events in distant places. Some of the most gripping events of recent decades—such as the fall of the Berlin Wall; the violent crackdown on democratic protesters in China’s Tiananmen Square; the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Paris in 2015, Brussels in 2016, Manchester and London in 2017; and the Arab Spring protests—unfolded through the media before a truly global audience. Such events, along with less dramatic ones, have caused a reorientation in people’s thinking from the level of the nation-state to the global stage.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This shift to a global outlook has two significant consequences. First, as members of a global community, people increasingly perceive that social responsibility extends beyond national borders. There is a growing assumption that the international community has an obligation to act in crisis situations to protect the physical well-being or human rights of people whose lives are under threat. In the case of natural disasters, such interventions take the form of humanitarian relief and technical assistance. In recent years, earthquakes in Haiti, floods in Mozambique, famine in Africa, hurricanes in Central America, the tsunami that hit Asia and Africa, and the 2015 earthquake in Nepal that claimed more than 8,000 lives and injured another 23,000 have been rallying points for global assistance. Today, with a growing awareness of the scientific consensus on the possible ramifications of global warming, environmental movements—united by social media—have mushroomed from the Marshall Islands to Miami.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There have also been stronger calls for interventions in the case of war, ethnic conflict, and the violation of human rights, although such mobilizations are more problematic than with natural disasters. In the case of the Gulf War in 1991 and the violent conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo (in the former Yugoslavia), many people saw military intervention as justified in the interest of defending human rights and national sovereignty.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Second, a global outlook means that people increasingly look to sources other than the nation-state in formulating their own sense of identity. This phenomenon is produced by and further accelerates processes of globalization. Local cultural identities in various parts of the world are experiencing powerful revivals at a time when the traditional hold of the nation-state is undergoing profound transformation. In Europe, for example, inhabitants of Scotland and the Basque region of Spain might be more likely to identify themselves as Scottish or Basque (or simply as Europeans) rather than as British or Spanish. The nation-state as a source of identity is waning in many areas as political shifts at the regional and global levels loosen people’s orientations toward the states in which they live. A form of nationalism based on ethnicity, religion, or <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_835" title="835"></span>culture—rather than nation-state—is reflected in growing persecution in many countries, and sometimes outright violence, against those perceived as non-native, such as immigrants or members of religious minorities.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Economic Changes: The Growing Importance of Transnational Corporations</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Among the many economic factors driving globalization, the role of transnational corporations is particularly important. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-transnational-corporations" href="part0130_split_005.html#transnational-corporations">Transnational corporations</a> are companies that produce goods or market services in more than one country. These may be small firms with one or two factories outside the country where they are based or gigantic international ventures whose operations crisscross the globe. Some of the biggest transnational corporations are Apple, Disney, ExxonMobil, Volkswagen, General Motors, Google, McDonald’s, Nike, Starbucks, Toyota, and Walmart. Even when transnational corporations have a clear national base, they are oriented toward global markets and global profits.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Transnational corporations account for some two-thirds of all world trade, are instrumental in diffusing new technology around the globe, and are major actors in international financial markets. As one group of writers has noted, they are “the linchpins of the contemporary world economy” (Held et al., 1999). A Swiss study of more than 43,000 transnational corporations found that a mere 737 firms—less than 2 percent of the total—accounted for four-fifths of their combined monetary value. The financial services industry is a power player in the global economy: The top 50 firms were primarily financial organizations such as banks and giant investment firms (Vitali, Glattfelder, and Battiston, 2011). The world’s 500 largest transnational corporations had combined revenues of more than $32.7 trillion in 2018 (<i class="italic">Fortune</i>, 2019); in the same year, $75.6 trillion in goods and services were produced by the entire world (World Bank, 2017c). While the United States remains home to the largest number of giant transnational corporations, its share has slipped considerably in recent years, particularly with the rise of Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and especially China.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Transnational corporations became a global phenomenon after World War II. Expansion initially came from firms based in the United States, but by the 1970s, European and Japanese firms also began to invest abroad. In the late 1980s and 1990s, transnational corporations expanded dramatically with the establishment of three powerful regional markets: Europe (the Single European Market), Asia-Pacific (the Osaka Declaration, which guaranteed free and open trade by 2010), and North America (the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA). Since the early 1990s, countries in other areas have also eased restrictions on foreign investment. By the turn of the twenty-first century, few economies were beyond the reach of transnational corporations. Over the past decade, transnational corporations based in industrialized economies have been expanding their operations in countries in the global south, as well as in countries in Eastern Europe and countries that were part of the former Soviet Union.</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The “electronic economy” also underpins economic globalization. Banks, corporations, fund managers, and individual investors can now shift funds internationally with <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_836" title="836"></span>the click of a mouse. This new ability carries great risks, however. Transfers of vast amounts of capital can destabilize economies and trigger international financial crises. As the global economy becomes increasingly integrated, a financial collapse in one part of the world can have an enormous effect on distant economies. This fact became painfully evident when the once-venerable financial services firm Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The collapse of Lehman Brothers, which held an estimated $600 billion in assets, caused financial shockwaves throughout the United States and global economies. The Dow Jones dropped by more than 4 percentage points immediately following Lehman’s filing for <a href="part0071_split_000.html#23MNU0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 11</a> bankruptcy. Banks and insurers throughout the world, from Scotland to Japan, registered devastating losses as a result (Council on Foreign Relations, 2013). The Dow’s drop following Lehman Brothers’ collapse was only recently topped in 2020 when the rise of coronavirus infections in the United States led the Dow Jones to drop over 12 percentage points, making it the largest single drop since the 9/11 attacks in 2001 (Imbert, 2020).</p>
