<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">By September 2019, Facebook had grown to more than 2.45 billion monthly active users worldwide, including 1.62 billion daily users (Facebook, 2019). This extensive use of social media is often believed to have a positive effect, especially on young people, who frequently spend hours posting status updates and photos on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and similar social networking sites. Nearly nine out of every ten young Americans (ages 18 to 29) report engaging in social networking, enabling them to connect with a large number of “friends,” which ideally provides them with a stronger sense of social connection (Perrin and Anderson, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In fact, surveys of Americans of all ages have found that Facebook users report having a slightly greater number of close relationships than do average Americans, and in turn, they receive slightly more emotional support and companionship (Pew Research Center, 2011c; Pew Research Center, 2014d). Yet research on the emotional effects of social media on young people paints a much less rosy picture. Multiple studies of young adults have found that people who used social media more frequently felt slightly worse over time, whereas those who reported increased direct interaction with their friends tended to feel better over time (Kross et al., 2013; Shakya and Christakis, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One possible explanation has to do with self-esteem—how people feel about themselves. There is some evidence that as social media interaction increases, self-esteem decreases, especially among women (Leif et al., 2012). Frequent social media users often closely monitor their friends’ posts, making unfavorable comparisons with their own lives. They are also more likely to be attentive to unfavorable responses to their own posts. One study found that young people with low self-esteem tend to complain about their lives on their social media pages, which in turn provokes negative responses, contributing to a downward emotional spiral (Forest and Wood, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Pop singer Taylor Swift may not be a sociologist, but her insights square with the recent research:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We are dealing with a huge self-esteem crisis. These girls are able to scroll pictures of the highlight reels of other people’s lives, and they’re <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_59" title="59"></span>stuck with the behind-the-scenes of their own lives. They wake up and they look at their reflection in the mirror, and they compare it to some filtered, beautiful photo of some girl who’s really popular and seems like she has it all together. (NPR, 2014)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The correct answer, unfortunately, is <i class="italic">c</i>: The effect of social media on young adults’ sense of themselves is more often negative than positive.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Nor are such effects of social media limited to the United States. China, now the world’s second-largest economy (and rapidly closing on the world’s largest—the United States), claims more than 829 million Internet users (Internet World Stats, 2019), and its own versions of Google (<i class="italic">Baidu</i>), Facebook (<i class="italic">Renren</i>), and Twitter (<i class="italic">Sina Weibo</i>). Although Facebook is currently banned in China, China’s own social media sites are widely used, with nearly two-thirds of Chinese over 18 plugged in (Pew Research Center, 2016e).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">China’s social media sites have been described by Chinese sociologist Liu Neng as “a place of escape” from the pressures of school, parental expectations, and even (as long as politics are not discussed) government censorship. The widespread use of social media encourages self-expression, a trait far more common among Chinese youth than among their parents’ generation (Rabkin, 2011). Young people in China increasingly rely on social media to form relationships, advertise their accomplishments, and flaunt their sense of worth. One study of university students in China found that students with higher self-esteem were more likely to post comments on social media sites; students with lower self-esteem presumably feared receiving unfavorable feedback (Wang et al., 2012). Chinese culture places an extremely high value on academic achievement and success in general. While no studies have yet focused on the relationship between the extent of social media use and self-esteem among young Chinese, it seems reasonable to conclude that in China, as in the United States, it is common for young people to compare their own posts with those of their friends; many will find such comparisons hurtful.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The lives of everyone on the planet are becoming increasingly interdependent. Few places on earth can escape radio, television, air travel (and its throngs of tourists), cell phones, or the Internet. A few generations ago, some peoples’ ways of life might have been untouched by the rest of the world. Today, these same people use tools made in the United States, Europe, or Japan; wear clothing manufactured in China, the Dominican Republic, or Bangladesh; and share personal information and photos on social media sites. While Facebook and Twitter are banned in China, a growing number of tech-savvy young Chinese are able to break through what has been termed the “Great Chinese Firewall.” But Renren, Sina Weibo, and other Chinese social media sites openly copy Facebook and Twitter. As their content converges with that of their non-Chinese counterparts, it would seem that a global culture is emerging across the planet.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some of the forces that contribute to such a global culture are discussed throughout this book:</p>
<ul class="contents">
<li class="bcpt"><span>Television, which brings U.S. culture into homes throughout the world daily and which adapts other cultural products for the U.S. audience</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_60" title="60"></span><span>The emergence of a unified global economy, with businesses whose factories, management structures, and markets span continents and countries</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>“Global citizens,” such as managers of large corporations (or university professors), who may spend so much time crisscrossing the globe that they identify with a global, cosmopolitan culture rather than with their own nation’s culture</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>A host of international organizations—including UN agencies, regional-trade and mutual-defense associations, multinational banks and other global financial institutions, and international labor and health organizations—that are creating a global political, legal, and military framework</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>Electronic communications (cell phones, email, the Internet), which make instantaneous communication with almost any part of the planet an integral part of daily life in the business world</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>The exploding use of smartphones and other devices, and the associated rise of social media such as Facebook and Twitter</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet the emergence of a global culture is far from self-evident. In fact, there is considerable evidence to the contrary. The Internet, while exposing billions of people around the world to ideas that often challenge some of their most cherished cultural beliefs and values, also has resulted in a strengthening of those beliefs and values in many places. Although the force of globalization can often seem to be irresistible, sweeping away everything in its path, globalization has also resulted in outright resistance to the homogenization of local cultures along European and North American lines.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In this chapter, we explore the nature of culture and society in their many forms, and how they are being reshaped by the many changes occurring in the world today.</p>
