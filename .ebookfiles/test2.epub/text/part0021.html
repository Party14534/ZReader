<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">We start our exploration of sociology by looking at the connections between individual development and culture and by analyzing types of societies from the past and present. Although our personalities and outlooks are influenced by our culture and society, we actively re-create and reshape the cultural and social contexts in which our activities occur. <a href="part0022_split_000.html#KVCC0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 3</a> examines the unity and diversity of human culture. We consider how human beings differ from and resemble nonhuman animals, and we analyze variations among human cultures. <a href="part0028_split_000.html#QMFO0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 4</a> discusses socialization, concentrating on how the human infant develops into a social being. Because socialization continues throughout the life course, we also analyze the relationships among young, middle-aged, and older people. <a href="part0034_split_000.html#doc-2.3.0">Chapter 5</a> explores how people interact in everyday life and identifies the mechanisms people use to interpret what others say and do. The study of social interaction reveals a great deal about the larger social environment. <a href="part0040_split_000.html#164MG0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 6</a> focuses on social groups, networks, and organizations, and how individuals interact in various settings. <a href="part0046_split_000.html#1BRPS0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 7</a> looks at deviance and crime. We can learn about the way a population behaves by studying people whose behavior deviates from accepted patterns.</b></p>
