<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Surveys</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Quantitative methodologists have a range of analytical tools and data resources at their disposal, but surveys are the most commonly used. When conducting a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-survey" href="part0018_split_007.html#survey">survey</a>, researchers ask subjects to provide answers to structured questionnaires, which are administered in person, over the phone, mailed or emailed to a select group of people. This group is known as a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-population" href="part0018_split_007.html#population">population</a>. While ethnographies are best suited for in-depth studies of small slices <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_41" title="41"></span>of social life, survey research produces information that is less detailed but can be generalized to the population as a whole.</p>
<section id="standardized-and-open-ended-questions">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Standardized and Open-Ended Questions</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Two types of questions are used in surveys. With <i class="italic">standardized</i>, or <i class="italic">fixed-choice</i>, questions, only a fixed range of responses is possible—for example, Yes, No, Don’t know or Very likely, Likely, Unlikely, Very unlikely. Such questions have the advantage that responses are easy to count and compare because only a small number of categories are involved. However, because they do not allow for subtleties of opinion or verbal expression, they may yield restrictive, if not misleading, information.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Open-ended questions, by contrast, typically provide more detailed information because respondents may express their views in their own words, and the researcher can ask follow-up questions to probe more deeply into what the respondent thinks. However, the lack of standardization means that responses may be difficult to compare statistically.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In surveys, all the items must be readily understandable to interviewers and interviewees alike. Questions are usually asked in a set order. In large national surveys undertaken by government agencies and research organizations, interviews occur more or less simultaneously across the country. Those who conduct the interviews and those who analyze the results could not work effectively if they constantly had to check with one another about ambiguities in the questions or answers.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Questionnaires should also accommodate the characteristics of respondents. Will they see the point of a particular question? Might it offend them? Do they have enough information to answer usefully? Will they answer at all? A questionnaire’s terminology might be unfamiliar; for instance, “What is your marital status?” might better be asked as, “Are you single, married, separated, or divorced?” Most surveys are preceded by pilot studies, which reveal problems with the survey not anticipated by the investigator. A <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-pilot-study" href="part0018_split_007.html#pilot-study">pilot study</a> is a trial run in which just a few people participate. Any difficulties can then be ironed out before the main survey takes place.</p>

<section id="sampling-section">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Sampling</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Often sociologists are interested in the characteristics of large numbers of individuals—for example, political attitudes of the American population as a whole. In such situations, researchers concentrate on a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-sample" href="part0018_split_007.html#sample">sample</a>, or a small proportion of the overall group. Usually, the results from a properly chosen sample can be generalized to the total population. Studies of only 2,000–3,000 voters, for instance, can accurately indicate the attitudes and voting intentions of the entire population. But to achieve such accuracy, we need a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-representative-sample" href="part0018_split_007.html#representative-sample">representative sample</a>; the group of individuals studied must be typical, or representative, of the population as a whole. Because <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-sampling" href="part0018_split_007.html#sampling">sampling</a> is highly complex, statisticians have developed rules for working out the correct size and nature of samples.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_42" title="42"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A particularly important procedure that ensures that a sample is representative is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-random-sampling" href="part0018_split_007.html#random-sampling">random sampling</a>, in which every member of the sample population has the same probability of being included. The most sophisticated way of obtaining a random sample is to assign each member of the population a number and then use a computer to generate a random list from which the sample is derived—for instance, by picking every tenth number. Random sampling is often done by researchers doing large population-based surveys, aimed to capture the behaviors or attitudes of the overall U.S. population. For qualitative researchers interested in a particular population, such as street vendors or gangsters, it simply would not make sense to try to draw a random sample.</p>

<section id="advantages-and-disadvantages-of-surveys">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Advantages and Disadvantages of Surveys</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Surveys are widely used in sociological research for several reasons. Questionnaire responses can be more easily quantified and analyzed than material generated by most other research methods; large numbers of people can be studied; and, given sufficient funds, researchers can employ a specialized agency to collect the responses. The scientific method is the model for this kind of research since surveys give researchers a statistical measure of what they are studying.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">However, many sociologists are critical of the survey method. They argue that findings whose accuracy may be dubious—given the relatively shallow nature of most survey responses—can nonetheless appear to be precise. Also, levels of nonresponse are sometimes high, especially now that so many people use cell phones and no longer have landlines at home. Furthermore, some published studies are based on results derived from little more than half a sample, though normally there is an effort to recontact nonrespondents or to substitute them with other people. Although little is known about those who do not respond to surveys or who refuse to be interviewed, we do know that people often experience survey research as intrusive and time-consuming. One development that may hold great promise for learning about public opinion is the rise of new statistical techniques for surveying the online conversation that is taking place quite naturally on the Internet.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_4">A Recent Example of a Survey</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the most famous contemporary surveys is the General Social Survey, which has been administered to Americans since 1972. It is sometimes called the “pulse of America,” as it has tracked the social life of Americans for decades. Since 1985, however, it has also been administered outside the United States to obtain comparative <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_43" title="43"></span>data. One of its most significant and controversial findings of recent years came from an analysis of the number of real-life “friends” Americans were reporting. The results suggested that Americans had fewer confidants than in the past, and that a growing number couldn’t name a single person with whom they shared “important matters.” The implication was that Americans were growing lonelier (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Brashears, 2006).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">How did the researchers evaluate whether friendships were declining over time? What accounts for this decline? The study was based on face-to-face interviews with a nationally representative sample of nearly 1,500 American adults. All had participated in the long-running General Social Survey and were asked questions about their social networks. Specifically, they were asked to identify people with whom they had discussed “matters [that are] important to [them]” in the past six months. On average, they named 2.08 people in 2004, compared to 2.94 people in 1985. The proportion of respondents who reported that there was no one with whom they discussed important matters jumped from 10 percent in 1985 to 25 percent in 2004.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some social scientists are not convinced that these findings support the claim that Americans are isolated or lonely. Rather, some argue that “weak” social ties, such as those with acquaintances, may be perfectly acceptable and rewarding for some people; these people may actually prefer to have many casual acquaintances rather than a handful of deep friendships. University of Toronto sociologist Barry Wellman (1994), for example, believes that the study offers important findings about “intimate ties,” but he questions whether these findings should be taken as evidence that Americans are lonely and isolated. Rather, he notes that people’s overall ties are actually increasing compared to previous decades, due in part to the Internet.</p>
