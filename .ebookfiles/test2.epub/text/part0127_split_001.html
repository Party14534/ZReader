<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">If you guessed the United States and Hollywood, you are not even close! India tops the list by far. In 2000, India produced more than 2,000 films, and by 2019 it had produced 2,446 feature films, resulting in nearly 2 billion admissions (UNESCO, 2017a; India Central Board of Film Certification, 2020). India’s film industry produces films in more than a dozen different languages, reflecting the extraordinary cultural and linguistic diversity of a country that is well known locally and globally for its Hindi-language “Bollywood” films, based in the city of Mumbai (Bombay).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Bollywood films are truly global in origin: They draw from such wide-ranging sources as twentieth-century Hollywood musicals, ancient Sanskrit dramas that combine lavish music and dance, Indian folk theater, and even MTV. The results are rich, elaborate films with romantic characters, numerous plots and subplots, lavish costuming, highly theatrical performances, and lots of dancing. Indian films have had widespread impact outside India: Satyajit Ray’s <i class="italic">Apu Trilogy</i> was released in the 1950s to critical acclaim and was ranked among the top 100 movies ever made by <i class="italic">Time</i> magazine. More recently, British filmmaker Danny Boyle’s Academy Award–winning film <i class="italic">Slumdog Millionaire</i>, based on an Indian novel, was filmed in Mumbai; Boyle—who also orchestrated the opening ceremony for the 2012 Olympics in London—credits Indian film as a major influence.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Nigeria comes in second, with more than 1,000 films in 2017, and by 2019, 2,000 film and TV productions. Unlike in India, many films in Nigeria are low budget: They are usually shot using digital handheld cameras, burned onto CDs, and sold inexpensively throughout Africa. A Nigerian online platform for on-demand films, called iRokoTV, streams these homegrown movies across the globe; even Netflix has a dedicated section for Nigerian films (Veselinovic, 2015; Saliu and Jun, 2019). The country’s burgeoning film industry, sometimes <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_819" title="819"></span>dubbed “Nollywood,” provides significant employment in the job-starved country: Nigeria’s film industry employs more than 1 million people and is the second-largest employer in the country after agriculture. It has its own Academy Awards, enlivened with visits from Hollywood movie stars such as Danny Glover and Forest Whitaker. While the films deal with a range of topics, they often draw on local themes and are shot on location, rather than in studios. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission (2016), Nigeria’s film industry is a $600 million business. Currently, it accounts for 0.27 percent of the Nigerian GDP (<i class="italic">The Guardian</i>, 2019). China came in fourth with 850 films in 2017. In the global sweepstakes of feature films, the United States ranked only fourth in 2017, producing 660 feature films—although its blockbuster, high-budget (and high-special-effects) films are popular throughout the world, accounting for the highest revenues. Japan came in fifth place with 594 films (UNESCO, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Films around the world draw on one another for themes, cinematographic techniques, and technology. While Hollywood remains an important influence, each country (indeed, in many countries, each region) has developed its own style and approach. The global film industry is an example of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-hybridity" href="part0127_split_002.html#hybridity">hybridity</a>—a notion borrowed from biology to capture the fact that cultures are neither isolated nor wholly distinct but in fact borrow from one another. This has been true historically and arguably has accelerated in recent years. Globalization today brings people, and their cultures, into intimate contact with one another, whether through travel or migration, economic interdependence, mass media, or popular culture. Social media play a key role in connecting people, films, and popular music across a global space.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Fairly recent on the horizon, after Latino rock, is Mandarin pop, a Cantonese and Pacific American combination of styles. One of its original inspirations is Hong Kong crooners doing Mandarin cover versions of Japanese popular ballads. The Japanese ballads were already a mixture of Japanese and American styles that featured, for instance, saxophone backgrounds. Mandarin pop (or Mandopop) is part of the soundscape of the Pacific Chinese diaspora. Its audience ranges from youngsters in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, to prosperous second-generation Chinese immigrants in the United States (Nederveen Pieterse, 2001).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In this chapter, we go beyond our earlier discussions of globalization, examining the ways global processes affect our lives on many levels. We explore how globalization has contributed to the profound social changes that are sweeping the world today and consider what the future is likely to bring.</p>
