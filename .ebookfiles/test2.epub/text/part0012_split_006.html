<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_6">Theoretical Thinking in Sociology</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">So far, we have been discussing theoretical approaches—broad orientations to the subject matter of sociology. Theoretical approaches are distinct from theories. Theories are more narrowly focused and represent attempts to explain particular social conditions or types of events. Theories are usually formed during the research process and in turn suggest other problems for subsequent research. An example would be Durkheim’s theory of suicide, referred to earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists do not share a unified position on whether theories should be specific, wide-ranging, or somewhere in between. Merton (1957), for example, argued that sociologists should concentrate on what he called theories of the middle range. Rather than attempting to create grand theoretical schemes (in the manner of Marx, for instance), sociologists should develop more modest theories. Middle-range theories are specific enough to be tested by empirical research, yet sufficiently general to cover a range of phenomena.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Consider the theory of relative deprivation, which holds that how people evaluate their circumstances depends on the persons to whom they compare themselves. Thus, feelings of deprivation do not conform directly to the level of material poverty one experiences. A family living in a small home in a poor area, where everyone is in similar circumstances, is likely to feel less deprived than a family living in a similar house in a neighborhood where other homes are much larger and other people more affluent.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Assessing theories in sociology, especially theoretical approaches, is a challenging and formidable task. The fact that there is no single theoretical approach that dominates the whole of sociology might be viewed as a limitation. But this is not the case: The jostling of rival theoretical approaches and theories actually highlights the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_25" title="25"></span>vitality of the sociological enterprise. In studying human beings (ourselves), theoretical variety rescues us from dogma. Human behavior is complex, and no single theoretical perspective could adequately cover all its aspects. Diversity in theoretical thinking provides a rich source of ideas for research and stimulates the imaginative capacities so essential to progress in sociological work.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Levels of Analysis: Microsociology and Macrosociology</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">An important distinction among the theoretical perspectives we’ve discussed in this chapter involves the level of analysis at which each is directed. The study of everyday behavior in situations of small-scale face-to-face interaction is called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-microsociology" href="part0012_split_007.html#microsociology">microsociology</a>. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-macrosociology" href="part0012_split_007.html#macrosociology">Macrosociology</a>, by contrast, is the analysis of large-scale social systems, such as the political system or the economy. It also includes analysis of long-term processes of change, such as the development of industrialization. Although micro analysis and macro analysis may seem distinct from each other, in fact, the two are closely connected (Giddens, 1984; Knorr-Cetina and Cicourel, 1981).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Macro analysis is essential for understanding the institutional background of daily life. The ways in which people live their everyday lives are shaped by the broader institutional framework. Consider a comparison of the daily cycle of activities in a medieval culture and in an industrialized urban environment. In modern societies, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_26" title="26"></span>we are constantly in contact with strangers—however indirect and impersonal. No matter how many indirect or electronic relationships we enter into, even the most complex societies require the presence of other people. While we may opt to just text or e-mail an acquaintance, we can also choose to fly thousands of miles to spend the weekend with a friend.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Micro studies, in turn, are necessary for illuminating broad institutional patterns. Face-to-face interaction is the basis of all forms of social organization, no matter how large scale. In studying a business corporation, we could analyze the face-to-face interactions of directors in the boardroom, staff working in their offices, or workers on the factory floor. We would not gain a clear picture of the whole corporation in this way, because some of its business involves e-mail, phone calls, and printed materials. Yet we could certainly contribute significantly to understanding how the organization works.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Later chapters will give further examples of how interaction in micro contexts affects larger social processes and how macro systems in turn influence the more confined settings of social life.</p>
