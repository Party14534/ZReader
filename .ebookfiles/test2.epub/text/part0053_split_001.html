<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 2016, an unknown 29-year-old bartender named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) rose to national prominence when she defeated a powerful long-time incumbent congressman from her own party in the Democratic primary and went on to win the general election in New York’s 14th congressional district. What was extraordinary about this feat was not simply that the candidate was a bartender, or still in her twenties, but that she was a self-identified socialist.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A socialist believes that government control of the economy—rather than a free-market capitalist system—will result in greater equality and democracy and be better for the working classes. Such ideas are currently more popular among young Americans now than during much of the twentieth century, when the country was generally averse to government interference in the economy. The correct answer to the opening question is <i class="italic">b</i>: These ideas are associated with one of the founders of sociology, Karl Marx.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">By the end of 2016, the ideas of Karl Marx had reached the height of popularity in modern politics through the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders, and this laid the groundwork for the emergence of candidates like AOC in 2018. What was it about Sanders and AOC that was so indebted to Karl Marx? It was that they both viewed the capitalist system, driven by the constant search for profits, as the major problem facing American society. These profits had created massive wealth for a very small percentage of the population, while others such as the new generation of college graduates were struggling as never before. To cite one example, by the end of 2019, outstanding student loans had reached $1.5 trillion, in comparison with credit card debt ($1.08 trillion) and automobile loans ($1.19 trillion) (Board of Governors <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_241" title="241"></span>of the Federal Reserve System, 2020a). Graduates of the class of 2018 had an average of around $29,200 in student loan debt (Institute for College Access &amp; Success, 2019). If you have a student loan, you are in good company: Two-thirds (65 percent) of graduating seniors have had to borrow to pay for the rising cost of higher education (Institute for College Access and Success, 2019). Politicians like Sanders and AOC highlight the economic and personal impacts of student debt and have made student loan forgiveness key aspects of their policy platforms.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Not all sociologists who are interested in inequality are concerned with capitalism, but the rise of socialist candidates in the United States has given new relevance to those scholars. We will discuss their work in this chapter, as well as others who are mainly interested in how differences in income and wealth affect one’s life chances, from getting an affordable college education to enjoying a middle-class lifestyle. Along the way, we will examine what sociologists have to say about social stratification—why social classes emerge, the reasons for social inequality, the degree to which a college education “pays off” in the sense of assuring a lifetime of earnings that will more than compensate for the cost of the education itself.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The differences explained here are directly related to the existence of inequalities within American society that result from class disparities. In this chapter, we will introduce a key concept of sociology: <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-stratification" href="part0053_split_002.html#social-stratification">social stratification</a>. By this we mean inequalities among individuals and groups that are determined not so much by individual personality or small-scale social situations but, more broadly, by attributes such as gender, age, race, ethnicity, or religious affiliation. The study of the interacting effects of these different sources of inequality, and the resulting experiences of oppression, is termed <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-intersectionality" href="part0053_split_002.html#intersectionality">intersectionality</a>.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In this chapter, we will focus on stratification with regard to societal inequalities based on social class—aspects of wealth, income, education, and lifestyle—although we will touch on gender, racial, and ethnic differences as well. In later chapters, we will consider more directly how gender (<a href="part0065_split_000.html#1TVKI0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 10</a>), race and ethnicity (<a href="part0071_split_000.html#23MNU0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 11</a>), and age (<a href="part0077_split_000.html#29DRA0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 12</a>) contribute to stratification.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Individuals and groups enjoy unequal access to rewards depending on their position within the larger stratification scheme. Stratification can thus be defined as <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-structured-inequalities" href="part0053_split_002.html#structured-inequalities">structured inequalities</a> between and among groups of people belonging to different classes, races, and genders. Sociologists see these inequalities as built into the economic and political system, rather than as resulting from individual differences or chance occurrences, such as being the most handsome or beautiful person in a class. We can picture stratification as the geological layering of rock in the earth’s surface. Societies consist of strata in a hierarchy, with the more favored at the top and the less privileged nearer the bottom.</p>
