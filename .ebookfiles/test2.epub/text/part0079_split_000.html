<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Social gerontologists have developed several influential theories of aging in Western society. Some of the earliest theories emphasized individual adaptation to changing social roles as a person grows older. Later theories focused on how society shapes the social roles of older adults, often in inequitable ways, and emphasized various aspects of age stratification. The most recent theories emphasize micro-macro links and focus on how persons ages 65+ actively create their lives within specific institutional and historical contexts (Bengston, Putney, and Johnson, 2005).</p>
