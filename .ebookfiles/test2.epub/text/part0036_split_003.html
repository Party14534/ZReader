<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although we routinely use nonverbal cues in our own behavior and in making sense of the behavior of others, much of our interaction is done through talk—casual verbal exchange—carried on in informal conversations with others. We can make sense of what is said in conversation only if we know the social context, which does not appear in the words themselves. Take the following conversation (Heritage, 1985):</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_149" title="149"></span>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">A: I have a fourteen-year-old son.</i></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">B: Well, that’s all right.</i></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">A: I also have a dog.</i></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">B: Oh, I’m sorry.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What do you think is happening here? What is the relationship between the speakers? What if you were told that this is a conversation between a prospective tenant and a landlord? The conversation then becomes sensible: Some landlords accept children but don’t permit their tenants to keep pets. Yet if we don’t know the social context, the responses of individual <i class="italic">B</i> seem to bear no relation to the statements of <i class="italic">A</i>. Part of the sense is in the words, and part is in the way in which the meaning emerges from the social context.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The most inconsequential forms of daily talk presume complicated, shared knowledge brought into play by those speaking. In fact, our small talk is so complex that it has so far proved impossible to program even the most sophisticated computers to converse with human beings. The words used in ordinary talk do not always have precise meanings, and we “fix” what we want to say through the unstated assumptions that back it up. If Maria asks Tom, “What did you do yesterday?” the words in the question themselves suggest no obvious answer. A day is a long time, and it would be logical for Tom to answer, “Well, at 7:16, I woke up. At 7:18, I got out of bed, went to the bathroom, and started to brush my teeth. At 7:19, I turned on the shower. . . .” We understand the type of response the question calls for by knowing Maria, what sort of activities she and Tom consider relevant, and what Tom usually does on a particular day of the week, among other things.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-ethnomethodology" href="part0036_split_004.html#ethnomethodology">Ethnomethodology</a> is the study of the “ethnomethods”—folk or lay methods—that people use to make sense of what others do and particularly of what they say. We all apply these methods, normally without giving any conscious attention to them. This field was created by Harold Garfinkel, who, along with Goffman, was one of the most important figures in the study of micro interaction.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Garfinkel argued that to understand the way people use context to make sense of the world, sociologists need to study the “background expectancies” with which we organize ordinary conversations. He highlighted these in some experiments he undertook with student volunteers (1963). The students were asked to engage a friend or relative in conversation and to insist that casual remarks or general comments be actively pursued to make their meaning precise. If someone said, “Have a nice day,” the student was to respond, “Nice in what sense, exactly?” “Which part of the day do you mean?” and so forth. One of the exchanges that resulted ran as follows (<i class="italic">S</i> is the friend; <i class="italic">E</i>, the student volunteer) (Garfinkel, 1963):</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">S: How are you?</i></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">E: How am I in regard to what? My health, my finances, my school work, my peace of mind, my . . . ?</i></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">S: (red in the face and suddenly out of control): Look! I was just trying to be polite. Frankly, I don’t give a damn how you are.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Why do people get so upset when apparently minor conventions of talk are not followed? The answer is that the stability and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_150" title="150"></span>meaningfulness of our daily social lives depend on the sharing of unstated cultural assumptions about what is said and why. If we weren’t able to take these for granted, meaningful communication would be impossible. Any question or contribution to a conversation would have to be followed by a massive “search procedure” of the sort Garfinkel’s subjects were told to initiate, and interaction would simply break down. What seem at first sight to be unimportant conventions of talk, therefore, turn out to be fundamental to the very fabric of social life, which is why their breach is so serious.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Note that in everyday life, people on occasion deliberately feign ignorance of unstated knowledge. This may be done to rebuff others, poke fun at them, cause embarrassment, or call attention to a double meaning in what was said. Consider, for example, this classic exchange between parent and teenager:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">P: Where are you going?</i></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">T: Out.</i></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">P: What are you going to do?</i></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">T: Nothing.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The responses of the teenager are effectively the opposite of those of the volunteers in Garfinkel’s experiments. The teenager declines to provide appropriate answers at all—essentially saying, “Mind your own business!”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The first question might elicit a different response from another person in another context:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">A: Where are you going?</i></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">B: I’m going quietly round the bend.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">B</i> deliberately misreads <i class="italic">A</i>’s question to convey worry or frustration in an ironic manner. Comedy and joking thrive on such deliberate misunderstandings of the unstated assumptions involved in talk. There is nothing threatening about this behavior, so long as the parties concerned recognize that the intent is to provoke laughter.</p>
