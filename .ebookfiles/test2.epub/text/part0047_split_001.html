<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">What Is Deviance?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-deviance" href="part0047_split_003.html#deviance">Deviance</a> may be defined as nonconformity to a set of norms that a significant number of people in a community or society accept. No society can be divided simply between those who deviate from norms and those who conform to them because most people sometimes transgress generally accepted rules of behavior. Although a large share of all deviant behavior (such as committing assault or murder) is also criminal and violates the law, many deviant behaviors—ranging from making bizarre fashion choices to joining a religious cult—are not criminal. By the same token, many behaviors that are technically “crimes,” such as underage drinking or exceeding the speed limit, are not considered deviant because they are quite normative (see Figure 7.1). Sociologists tend to focus much of their research on behaviors that are both criminal and deviant because such behaviors have importance for the safety and well-being of our nation.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although most of us associate the word <i class="italic">deviant</i> with behaviors that we view as dangerous or unsavory, assessments of deviance are truly in the eye of the beholder, as our next example will illustrate. Kevin Mitnick has been described as the “world’s most celebrated computer hacker.” To computer hackers everywhere, Mitnick is a pathbreaking genius whose five-year imprisonment in a U.S. penitentiary was unjust and unwarranted—proof of how misunderstood computer hacking has become with the spread of information technology. To U.S. authorities and high-tech corporations, Mitnick is one of the world’s most dangerous men. A recent study found that hackers—the leading cause of data breaches—were responsible for 48 percent of data breaches in 2018 (Verizon, 2018). Mitnick was captured by the FBI in 1995 and later convicted of downloading source code and stealing software allegedly worth millions of dollars from companies such as Motorola and Sun Microsystems. As a condition of his release from prison in January 2000, Mitnick was barred from using any communications technology other than a landline telephone. He successfully fought this legal decision and gained access to the Internet. He now is a consultant and best-selling author who teaches others about computer security (Mitnick and Simon, 2011).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Over the past decade or so, hackers have gradually evolved from a little-noticed population of computer enthusiasts to a much-reviled group of deviants who are believed to threaten the very stability of the information age. Yet, according to Mitnick and others in the hacker community, such depictions could not be further from the truth. Hackers are quick to point out that most of their activities are not criminal. Rather, they are primarily interested in exploring the edges of computer technology, trying to uncover loopholes and discover the extent to which it is possible to penetrate other computer systems. Once they discover flaws, the “hacker ethic” demands <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_201" title="201"></span>that they share information publicly. Many hackers have even served as consultants for large corporations and government agencies, helping them defend their systems against outside intrusion.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Deviance does not refer only to individual behavior; it concerns the activities of groups as well. Heaven’s Gate was a religious group whose beliefs and practices were different from those of the majority of Americans. The cult was established in the early 1970s when Marshall Herff Applewhite made his way around the West and Midwest of the United States preaching his beliefs, ultimately advertising on the Internet in the early 1990s his belief that civilization was doomed and the only way people could be saved was to kill themselves so their souls could be rescued by a UFO. On March 26, 1997, 39 members of the cult followed his advice in a mass suicide at a wealthy estate in Rancho Santa Fe, California.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Heaven’s Gate cult represents an example of a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-deviant-subculture" href="part0047_split_003.html#deviant-subculture">deviant subculture</a>. Its members were able to survive fairly easily within the wider society, supporting themselves by running a website business and using the Internet to recruit new members. They had plenty of money and lived together in an expensive home in a wealthy California suburb.</p>
