<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">What Do Sociologists of Religion Study?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Several types of social forces are of special interest to sociologists of religion. First, sociologists study the ways in which a crisis in prevailing beliefs promotes religious fervor. Such a crisis occurred in the United States during the 1960s as a result of the civil rights movement, opposition to the Vietnam War, social movements among racial and ethnic minorities, and the youth-oriented counterculture. Large numbers of people were attracted to religious teachers, ranging from Indian gurus to fundamentalist preachers, who offered everything from meditation and yoga to astrology and New Age religions (Wuthnow, 1988, 1998).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There is currently a resurgence of religious fervor throughout the world among Christians, Muslims, and Jews; while the reasons for this resurgence are not fully understood, part of the explanation has to do with the global changes sweeping the world today (Juergensmeyer, 2009). These include the failure of nonreligious institutions, particularly governments, to promote political and economic security in many parts of the world; the global spread of cultural norms and values and their perceived threat to traditional beliefs and values; and the explosion of new forms of media, especially the Internet, which has made it easier for religiously like-minded people to share their beliefs and build their religious institutions.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Second, sociologists study how competition among religious organizations leads some to thrive and others to perish. This study has sparked an increased interest in the organizational dynamics of religious groups (Finke and Stark, 1988, 2005; Hammond, 1992; Roof and McKinney, 1990; Stark and Bainbridge, 1987).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Third, sociologists address the relationship among religion, ethnic identity, and politics. This interconnection is seen in the resurgence of ethnically based religion in pluralist societies such as the United States and in the rise of religious nationalism worldwide (Juergensmeyer, 1993, 2008; Lawrence, 1989; Merkyl and Smart, 1983; Sahliyeh, 1990; see later discussion of religious nationalism).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although the sociology of religion has long included non-European religions, there has been a tendency to view all religions through concepts based in the European experience. For example, notions such as <i class="italic">denomination</i>, <i class="italic">sect</i>, and <i class="italic">cult</i> (defined in the next section) presuppose formally organized religious institutions; they are of questionable utility in studying religions that emphasize spiritual practice as a part of daily life or that pursue the complete integration of religion with civic and political life. Recently, there has been an effort to create a comparative sociology of religion that examines religious traditions from within their own frames of reference (Juergensmeyer, 1993; Smart, 1989; van der Veer, 1994; Wilson, 1982).</p>
