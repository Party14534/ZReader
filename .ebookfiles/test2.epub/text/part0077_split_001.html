<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What do the terms <i class="italic">senior citizen</i>, <i class="italic">elderly</i>, or <i class="italic">old age</i> conjure up in your mind? For many Americans, old age is viewed as a time of senility, poverty, poor health, loneliness, and celibacy. Others view old age as a “golden” time, when cash-flush retirees sell their homes, move to Florida, and live the good life, surrounded by their golf buddies and devoted grandchildren (Carr, 2019). The truth is somewhere in between. Older adults—persons ages 65 and older—are a highly diverse group, with some enjoying good health, wealth, and happiness, and others suffering from poverty, illness, physical disability, and loneliness. This divide was especially apparent during the COVID-19 crisis of 2020; older adults were dying in large numbers, with those in poor health even prior to the pandemic the most vulnerable. Often, the trajectories that set one on the path toward a rewarding or distressing later life begin decades earlier, sometimes as early as childhood.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Witness the cases of Judy Hofstadter and Alice Garvin. Judy Hofstadter, 81, lives in New York City and works full time as a financial planner at a large firm. She keeps up a vigorous exercise regimen, shops weekly at the local farmers’ market for healthy food, devotes time to organizations promoting peace in the Middle East, and donates her time and money to political candidates she believes in. In 2006, while going door to door before midterm elections, she tripped and broke her wrist. “I sacrificed my hand in service to my country,” Hofstadter says, laughing. Although she now suffers from breast cancer, significant hearing loss, a serious case of glaucoma, and excruciating neck and back pain, “she has learned to make lemonade from everything,” according to her son David Tuller (2009).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Hofstadter learned at a young age how to overcome challenges with her sense of humor <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_419" title="419"></span>intact. Born into a middle-class Jewish family that promoted academic achievement, Hofstadter entered Harvard Law School in 1951, joining only the second class to admit women. She married a physician who was physically abusive, so she gathered up the courage to take her two children and leave him. To preserve her spirit during those difficult years after she left, as her son David notes, “She funneled her energy and passion into political and social causes. She fought for integrated housing and civil liberties and infused [her children] with her progressive spirit” (Tuller, 2009).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Her fighting spirit hasn’t waned in later life. When she was first diagnosed with breast cancer, David said that she “investigated the issue like a lawyer. . . . She scoured the literature, interrogated researchers at medical conferences, and joined the boards of breast cancer advocacy groups.” Her son proudly describes her as “my model . . . for how to age with grace, compassion and vitality.” According to Hofstadter, “I think having passions takes you outside of yourself and animates your life. . . . It makes you want to take care of yourself so you can keep on going. I still look forward to the next adventure.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Hofstadter is fortunate to have had a prestigious education, an intellectually challenging and well-paying career, two emotionally supportive and financially secure children—one a professor, the other a therapist—and a well-honed sense of problem solving. Not all older adults are so lucky. Just a few miles away, in Brooklyn, 77-year-old Alice Garvin has been dealt a much worse hand.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Alice Garvin is now fighting foreclosure, while also struggling to support her children, grandchildren, great-grandson, and grandnephew. Garvin, a retired home health aide, first faced foreclosure four years ago when she found an eviction notice on the front door of her apartment building (Mascia, 2009). The second time, the loss of her apartment was a blessing in disguise; she was evicted from a rundown apartment in a dangerous neighborhood “she couldn’t wait to leave” because of gunshots outside and “bugs falling from the ceiling” (Mascia, 2009). In both cases, Mascia notes, “Foreclosure was beyond her control: she is not a homeowner, but a tenant.” Garvin was saved by a local charity that provided her with money so she could move into a new apartment big enough for her and her large extended family.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Now in her new apartment, Garvin continues to struggle financially. Her family “survives on a patchwork of welfare,” including Social Security for Garvin, disability payments for her children and grandchildren, and an occasional visit to a food pantry. Foreclosure and economic struggles are difficult for anyone, but for Garvin, “it is just the latest blow in a lifetime filled with difficulty.” Born in South Carolina, Garvin was “an orphan by the time she was 14; she was 36 when her husband died from an alcohol-related illness. Four of her six children have died”—one from the effects of Agent Orange exposure in the Vietnam War, two from pneumonia, and one from AIDS.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Garvin is caregiver and financial provider to her two surviving sons; one cannot work because of a congenital heart problem, and the other was nearly beaten to death in a mugging 20 years ago and cannot work due to frequent seizures. Her two teenage grandsons and grandnephew were born addicted to cocaine and have lingering behavioral problems. And this past spring, Garvin became a great-grandmother. Despite her seemingly insurmountable responsibilities, she keeps a positive attitude: “I try to look forward, not back. I have a lot to keep me going now.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Growing old can be a fulfilling and rewarding experience, as Judy Hofstadter knows. Or it can be filled with adversity and stress, as Alice Garvin has discovered. For <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_420" title="420"></span>most older Americans, the experience of aging lies somewhere in between. How we experience old age is shaped by our gender, race, social class, and historical context. Yet aging also is a cumulative process and is molded by our experiences, resources, and struggles in earlier life. How older adults navigate their later years reflects not only their personal resources, such as optimism, problem-solving skills, and energy, but also structural factors, such as economic opportunities and public policies.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although old age is often accompanied by physical and cognitive declines and economic and psychological distress—as the lives of Hofstadter and Garvin reveal—more Americans are leading longer, healthier, and more productive lives than ever before. In 2020, more than 56 million Americans were age 65 or older, comprising 17 percent of the U.S. population, including more than 6.7 million adults over 85 years old (Mather and Kilduff, 2020). In this chapter, we examine the nature of aging in U.S. society, exploring what it means to grow old in a world that is rapidly changing.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We first review the core concepts of aging, including the graying of the U.S. population and biological, psychological, and social aspects of aging. We next look at sociological theories that describe how people adapt to growing old. This will lead us to a discussion of contemporary research on aging in the United States, focusing on some of the special challenges facing older adults, including social isolation, health declines, and elder abuse. We next delve into important, although unresolved, questions regarding political and economic issues surrounding the aging of the American population, including Social Security and Medicare. The future of these programs affects the lives of all Americans and will gain increasing significance given the growing numbers of older people. We conclude with a discussion of the graying of the world population and what this means for individuals, governments, and societies.</p>
