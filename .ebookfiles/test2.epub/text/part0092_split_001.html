<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There have been at least four general stages in the development of business <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-corporations" href="part0092_split_005.html#corporations">corporations</a>, although each overlaps with the others and all continue to coexist today. Some sociologists see a fifth stage emerging as well.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The first stage, characteristic of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, was dominated by <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-family-capitalism" href="part0092_split_005.html#family-capitalism">family capitalism</a>. Large firms were run either by individual <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-entrepreneur" href="part0092_split_005.html#entrepreneur">entrepreneurs</a> or by members of the same family, and then passed on to their descendants. The famous corporate dynasties, such as the Rockefellers and Fords, belong in this category. These individuals and families did not just own a single large corporation but held a diversity of economic interests and stood at the apex of economic empires.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most of the big firms founded by entrepreneurial families have since become public companies—that is, shares of their stock are traded on the open market—and have passed into managerial control. But important elements of family capitalism remain, even within some of the largest corporations, such as 21st Century Fox, which in 2015 was the world’s fourth-largest media conglomerate until it was acquired by the Walt Disney Corporation in 2019. 21st Century Fox had been the owner of Fox News, FX, Hulu, and a host <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_515" title="515"></span>of worldwide cable networks and satellite broadcasters (Fox Corporation held on to its television networks after the sale). Australian-born founder, Rupert Murdoch, who turned 88 in 2019, took over his father’s struggling media business in 1953, building it into a global media empire and then passing control to his two sons, Lachlan and James Murdoch, in 2015 (Hagey, 2015).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Among small firms, such as local owner-run shops, small plumbing and house-painting businesses, and so forth, family capitalism continues to dominate. Some of these firms, such as shops that remain in the hands of the same family for two or more generations, are also dynasties, albeit on a minor scale. However, the small-business sector is highly unstable, and economic failure is common; the proportion of firms owned by members of the same family for extended periods is minuscule.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the large corporate sector, family capitalism was increasingly succeeded by <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-managerial-capitalism" href="part0092_split_005.html#managerial-capitalism">managerial capitalism</a>. As managers came to have more and more influence through the growth of very large firms, the entrepreneurial families were displaced. The result has been described as the replacement of the family in the company by the company itself. The company is no longer privately owned by the founding family, but rather is publicly traded on the stock market, in theory giving everyone an opportunity to buy shares and become an owner. The corporation thus emerged as a more defined economic entity, with professional management—although as we shall see later in this chapter, ownership (and therefore a degree of control) is likely concentrated in a relatively small number of shareholders. There is no question that managerial capitalism has left an indelible imprint on modern society. The large corporation drives not only patterns of consumption but also the experience of employment in contemporary society—as large corporations have moved much of their production overseas, the work lives of many Americans have changed. Those changes have often involved the loss of higher-paying jobs in large, unionized factories, and their replacement with lower-paying service jobs, from serving food in restaurants to driving for Lyft or Uber.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists have identified another area in which the large corporation has left a mark on modern institutions. Representing <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_516" title="516"></span>the third stage in the development of business corporations, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-welfare-capitalism" href="part0092_split_005.html#welfare-capitalism">welfare capitalism</a> refers to a practice that sought to make the corporation—rather than the state or trade unions—the primary shelter from the uncertainties of the market in modern industrial life. Beginning at the end of the nineteenth century, large firms began to provide certain services to their employees, including childcare, recreational facilities, profit-sharing plans, paid vacations, and life and unemployment insurance. By the end of World War II, many corporations, as well as public employers such as governments and educational institutions, also began to offset much of the cost of purchasing private medical insurance for their employees. These programs often had a paternalistic bent, such as sponsoring “home visits” for the “moral education” of employees. Viewed in less benevolent terms, welfare capitalism had as one of its major objectives coercion, as employers deployed all manner of tactics, including violence, to avoid unionization. As such, conventional histories typically suggest that welfare capitalism met its demise in the Great Depression years, as labor unions achieved unprecedented levels of influence and as the New Deal administration began to guarantee many of the benefits provided by firms.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In contrast to this standard interpretation, others argue that welfare capitalism did not die but instead went underground during the height of the labor movement (Jacoby, 1998). In firms that avoided unionization during the period between the 1930s and 1960s—such as Kodak, Sears, and Thompson Products—welfare capitalism was modernized, shedding blatantly paternalistic aspects and routinizing benefit programs. When the union movement began to weaken after 1970, these companies offered a model to other firms such as Walmart, which were then able to press their advantage against unions, reasserting the role of the firm as “industrial manor” and workers as “industrial serfs.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many scholars now see the contours of a fourth phase emerging in the evolution of the corporation. They argue that managerial capitalism has today partly ceded place to <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-institutional-capitalism" href="part0092_split_005.html#institutional-capitalism">institutional capitalism</a>. This term refers to the emergence of a consolidated network of business leadership, concerned not only with decision making within single firms but also with the development of corporate power beyond them. Institutional capitalism is based on the practice of corporations holding stock shares in other firms. In effect, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-interlocking-directorates" href="part0092_split_005.html#interlocking-directorates">interlocking directorates</a>—linkages among corporations created by individuals who sit on two or more corporate boards—exercise control over much of the corporate landscape (Calazza et al., 2018). This system reverses the process of increasing managerial control because the large blocks of shares other corporations own dwarf the managers’ shareholdings. For example, JPMorgan Chase, one of the world’s largest financial services and banking corporations, is itself owned in large part by a half dozen other financial service companies that control more than a quarter of the company’s stock. The two largest individual shareholders—one the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the other one a member of its board of directors—together account for less than 1 percent of the total stock (Downie, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the main reasons for the spread of institutional capitalism is the shift in patterns of investment that has occurred since the 1970s. Rather than investing directly by buying shares in a business, individuals now invest in money market, trust, insurance, and pension funds that are controlled by large financial organizations, which in turn invest these grouped savings in industrial corporations.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_517" title="517"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Finally, some sociologists argue that we have now entered a fifth stage in the development of business corporations—a form of institutional capitalism they see as <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-global-capitalism" href="part0092_split_005.html#global-capitalism">global capitalism</a>. According to this view, corporations are increasingly stateless: giant transnational entities that roam freely around the planet in search of lower costs and higher profits, loyal to no country regardless of where they might be headquartered. The major corporations today are global not only in the sense that they operate transnationally, but also because their shareholders, directors, and top officers are drawn from many countries (<a href="part0059_split_000.html#1O8H60-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 9</a>) (Robinson, 2004, 2014, 2018, 2019; Sklair, 2000).</p>
