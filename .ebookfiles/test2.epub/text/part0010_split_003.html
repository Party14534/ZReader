<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A long-standing debate in the social sciences revolves around questions of free will and determinism. For example, a deterministic framework would predict that where an individual ends up in life is significantly, if not entirely, influenced by the position into which he or she is born. The sociological imagination can be quite deterministic in that it pushes us to see that, in many ways, the lives of individuals are quite determined by their social roles, gender, race, and class. Yet we would not want you to take away the lesson that individuals are trapped or controlled like puppets.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Take the example of college admissions. It is true that Ivy League graduates have a significantly higher average income than graduates of state-level schools. This difference in income would suggest that the place at which one attends college is a crucial determinant of one’s success in later life. However, conventional studies looked only at students who had the same SAT scores and grades; they did not factor in other, personal characteristics that may have had an effect on later success in life.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 2002, Alan Krueger and Stacy Dale published a study comparing the average yearly incomes of students who had attended an Ivy League college with those who had been admitted to an Ivy League school but chose to attend a state-level college instead. Despite an apparent disparity in opportunities for students who attended Ivy League versus non–Ivy League universities, Krueger and Dale discovered that the average salaries of the two groups of students were essentially the same. However, this study was extended and updated in 2011 and found that there were some notable exceptions to these outcomes. The 2011 study found that for Black and Hispanic students from households with less-educated parents, earning degrees from Ivy League universities did matter (on capitalization of racial and ethnic groups, see preface). While the popular conception that attending elite institutions guarantees future success may not be true for all students, it does appear that racial and socioeconomic disparities do matter for some groups of students (2002; 2011; Gladwell, 2005).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists tend to think in probabilities. They look at the probabilities that people will end up in certain living situations on the basis of characteristics, de-emphasizing to some extent the power of the individual. However, the sociological imagination does leave room for the person to have an impact, even as we acknowledge that he or she is constrained.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Think about a girl from a working-class family whose parents have active sociological imaginations and a very deterministic understanding of their child’s life chances. The parents did not go to college. Instead, they entered the workforce after high school, and they expect that their daughter will do the same. When the teenager tells her parents that she would like to go to college and be a lawyer, the parents <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_11" title="11"></span>might think of the probability of an individual from their class position achieving such a goal—how unlikely it is. They might tell their child to consider the odds against her and encourage her to pursue a different goal so that she will not be disappointed. What if she took this advice with a grain of salt and applied to college anyway? She would be no different from many of your classmates—and possibly even you. Many of you can think of people who started out just like this, with similar constraints, but who ended up in college due to their refusal to accept the odds as their fate.</p>
