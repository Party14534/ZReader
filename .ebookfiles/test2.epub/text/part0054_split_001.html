<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Systems of Stratification</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Historically, a few basic systems of stratification have existed in human societies: slavery, caste, and class. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-slavery" href="part0054_split_002.html#slavery">Slavery</a> is an extreme form of inequality in which some individuals are literally owned by others as property. As a formal institution, slavery is illegal in every country and has almost completely disappeared.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-caste" href="part0054_split_002.html#caste">Caste</a> is associated with the cultures of the Indian subcontinent and the Hindu belief in rebirth. In caste systems, one’s social status is given for life. This means that all individuals must remain at the social level of their birth throughout their life. It is believed that individuals who fail to abide by the rituals and duties of their caste will be reborn in an inferior position in their next life. Caste systems structure the type of contact that can occur between members of different ranks.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-class-systems" href="part0054_split_002.html#class-systems">Class systems</a> differ in many respects from slavery and castes. We can define a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-class" href="part0054_split_002.html#class">class</a> as a large-scale grouping of people who share common economic resources that strongly influence the type of lifestyle they are able to lead. The concept of life chances, introduced by Max Weber, is the best way to understand what class means. Your <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-life-chances" href="part0054_split_002.html#life-chances">life chances</a> are the opportunities you have for achieving economic prosperity. The idea of life chances is important because it emphasizes that although class is a powerful influence on what happens in our lives, it is not completely determining. Class divisions affect which neighborhoods we live in, what lifestyles we follow, and even which romantic partners we choose (Mare, 1991; Massey, 1996). But they don’t fix people for life in specific social positions, as the older systems of stratification did. Class systems differ from slavery and castes in four main ways: Class systems are fluid, and movement is possible; positions are partly achieved; classes are economically based; and class systems are large-scale and impersonal. The chief bases of class are income, ownership of wealth, education, occupation, and lifestyle.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Let’s begin our exploration of classes in modern societies by looking at basic divisions of income, wealth, educational attainment, and occupational status within the population as a whole.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_243" title="243"></span>
<section id="income-section">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Income</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-income" href="part0054_split_002.html#income">Income</a>, which refers to wages and salaries earned from paid occupations plus money received from investments, serves as an important determinant of one’s social position. One of the most significant changes over the past century has been the rising real income of the majority of the working population. (“Real income” is income excluding increases due to inflation, and provides a fixed standard of comparison from year to year.) Blue-collar workers, who typically perform physical labor such as manufacturing or construction work, now earn three to four times as much in real income in Western societies as their counterparts earned in the early 1900s, although they have seen their real income drop in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. Gains for managerial and professional workers, often known as “white-collar workers,” have been higher still. In terms of earnings per person (per capita) and the range of goods and services their earnings can purchase, many Americans today are more affluent than any peoples have previously been in human history. One of the most important reasons for this is “increasing productivity”—output per worker—through technological development in industry. Another reason is almost everything we consume is now made in countries where wages are extremely low, keeping costs (and therefore prices) down. While this situation has been good for American consumers, it has not been so good for American workers, as we shall see later in this chapter, as well as in <a href="part0059_split_000.html#1O8H60-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapters 9</a> and <a href="part0090_split_000.html#2LQIK0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">14</a>.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Even though real income has risen in the past century, these earnings have not been distributed evenly across groups. In other words, not everyone has shared equally in the growing productivity of the U.S. economy. Between 1993 and 2015, the average income of the bottom 99 percent of American households only grew by about 14 percent. In contrast, the income of the top 1 percent of households jumped nearly 95 percent (Saez, 2016). In 2018, the mean household income of the top 5 percent was around $416,520, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, compared to under $13,775 for the bottom 20 percent of American households (Semega et al., 2019) (Figure 8.1).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Since the 1970s, income inequality has been increasing dramatically; it is currently greater than at any time since 1928, the year before the Great Depression. In 1928, the richest 1 percent of families received nearly a quarter of all U.S. pretax income, while the bottom 90 percent (that is, everyone except the richest 10 percent) received about half. The Depression, which wiped out much of the wealth in the country and left millions unemployed, led to government policies aimed in part at protecting working- and middle-class Americans. President Franklin <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_244" title="244"></span>Delano Roosevelt’s “New Deal,” which created Social Security, welfare, housing, and many public works, resulted in the redistribution of income from the wealthiest Americans to working-class Americans. By 1944, the richest 1 percent of Americans were down to about a tenth of all U.S. pretax income, while the bottom 90 percent were up to two-thirds, an income distribution that remained until the end of the 1970s.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, the richest 1 percent are back up to over a quarter, while the lowest 90 percent are below half—for the first time since the U.S. government has kept records of income distribution. And inequality appears to be worsening. Between 1993 and 2018, the average income of American families rose by 30 percent; however, this growth was not shared evenly. The average income of the top 1 percent of all American families grew by 100.5 percent, while the average income of the bottom 99 percent rose by 18.3 percent. This means that the top 1 percent captured almost 50 percent of all gains in income over the period (Saez, 2018).</p>

<section id="wealth-section">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Wealth</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-wealth" href="part0054_split_002.html#wealth">Wealth</a> is usually measured in terms of net worth: all the assets one owns (for example, cash, savings and checking accounts, investments in stocks and bonds, and real estate properties) minus one’s debts (for example, home mortgages, credit card balances, loans that need to be repaid). Jeff Bezos, the richest person in the world in 2020, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_245" title="245"></span>had an estimated net worth in that year of $110.5 billion, derived largely from the value of Amazon stock that he owns.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is extremely difficult to get a truly accurate measure of wealth in the United States because the wealthiest Americans have ways of effectively hiding their wealth through trusts and foundations, as well as offshore tax havens and other tax shelters (Saez and Zucman, 2016). Nonetheless, some highly detailed (and mathematically sophisticated) efforts have recently been made to get a better picture of trends in wealth concentration (Piketty and Goldhammer, 2014; Piketty and Zucman, 2014; Saez and Zucman, 2016; Alvaredo, Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez, 2013). This research finds that trends in wealth inequality parallel those with income inequality: The rich are getting much, much wealthier relative to everyone else, mainly due to soaring top incomes. In the 1920s, before the Great Depression, the bottom 90 percent of Americans accounted for one-fifth of total wealth in the United States. In the mid-1980s, their share had risen to more than a third; but today, it has dropped to under a quarter. The vast majority of Americans are saddled with unpaid credit cards, and, as we learned in the chapter opener, many owe money for student loans, automobiles, and home mortgages.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The type of wealth one has also differs between the very rich and everybody else. Although most people make money from work, the wealthy often derive the bulk of their money from their investments, some of which may be inherited. Some scholars argue that wealth, not income, is the real indicator of social class because it is less sensitive to fluctuations due to shifting work hours, health, and other factors that might affect one’s income in a given year. Much of the wealth of the wealthy lies in financial assets such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other forms of investment, whereas for most Americans, their home is the principal form of wealth. For households whose net worth is in excess of $500,000, financial assets account for 75 percent of all wealth; only 13.5 percent comes from their homes. For all other households, homes account for more than half of their wealth, with only a third coming from financial assets (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2020a; Shorrocks et al., 2019a).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, the average net worth of all American families is only $97,300, while the average net worth of the top 10 percent has grown to $1.6 million, the top 1 percent to $4 million and that of the top 0.1 percent, $111 million (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2020a; Gold, 2017). Stated somewhat differently, the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans (160,700 families) have about as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent (144 million families) (Saez and Zucman, 2016). There are significant differences in net worth by race. The median net worth of White households was $171,000 in 2013, compared to $17,600 for Blacks (Dettling et al., 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What are some of the reasons for the racial disparity in financial assets? The old adage “It takes money to make money” is a fact of life for those who start with little or no wealth. Because Whites, on average, have enjoyed higher incomes and levels of wealth than Blacks have, many Whites can accrue even more wealth, which they pass on to their children (Conley, 1999). But family advantages are not the only factors. Melvin Oliver and Thomas Shapiro (2006) argue that it is easier for Whites to obtain assets, even when they have fewer resources than Blacks do, because discrimination affects the racial gap in home ownership. Blacks are rejected for mortgages 60 percent more often than Whites are, even when they have the same qualifications and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_246" title="246"></span>creditworthiness. A recent study found that in 2016, Blacks were denied loans 21 percent of the time as compared to Whites who were denied 8.1 percent of the time (Yale, 2018). When Blacks do receive mortgages, they are more likely to take “subprime” mortgage loans that charge much higher interest rates. In 2006, 30 percent of Blacks took out subprime home loans, compared with 24 percent of Hispanics and 18 percent of Whites. Blacks and Hispanics were therefore especially hard hit by the recession of 2008; many were forced to default on their mortgage payments and, in many cases, lost their homes. Research shows that only a few lenders offer subprime loans, but those lenders focus on minority communities, whereas the prime lenders are unable or unwilling to lend in those communities (Avery, Canner, and Cook, 2005). According to a <i class="italic">New York Times</i> analysis of mortgage lending in New York City, Black households making more than $68,000 a year were nearly five times as likely to hold high-interest subprime mortgages as Whites of similar or lower income levels (Powell, 2009). Furthermore, the National Bureau of Economic Research conducted a study which was later published that showed that Black homebuyers were 103 percent and Hispanic homebuyers were 78 percent more likely to have high cost home mortgages as compared to Whites (Bayer, Ferreira, and Ross, 2018). These issues are particularly important because home ownership constitutes American families’ primary means of accumulating wealth.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Financial assets are important because they provide a major source of funding if one wants to start a business or pay for a college education. For lower-income Americans (which includes many minorities), accumulating stocks or bonds in the hope of cashing them in to pay for their children’s college education is not even a fantasy. In fact, it is more likely that people in this group owe far more than they own. In recent years, as credit has become more readily available, many Americans have gone increasingly into debt, using credit cards and refinancing their home mortgages to pay for their lifestyles rather than relying on their earnings. Total household debt exceeded $14.15 trillion in 2019, including $9.6 trillion for home mortgages, and, as noted at the beginning of this chapter, $1.08 trillion in credit card and $1.2 trillion in automobile loans (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2020a; Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2020). That means that the average household with debt owes more than $130,000 (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Wealth is even more unequal globally. There are reportedly 2,153 billionaires in the world, with a combined net worth of more than $8.7 trillion (Kroll and Dolan, 2019a). According to some estimates, the wealthiest 1 percent now account for almost half of all global wealth (Shorrocks et al., 2019). We’ll come back to this topic in <a href="part0059_split_000.html#1O8H60-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 9</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="education">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Education</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One thing that pays off in terms of income and wealth is a college education. In fact, education is one of the strongest predictors of occupation, income, and wealth later in life. In 2018, the median income of millenials (25 to 34 years old) with bachelor’s degrees and full-time jobs was $54,700, compared to $34,900 for those who only graduated from high school, a gap of 57 percent (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2019d). Moreover, the return on a college education has increased considerably over time: In 1966, for example, the income gap between those with a college degree and those with a high school diploma was only 24 percent (Pew Research Center, 2014c). A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute reports that in 2017, the hourly earnings of college graduates was nearly double that of people without a degree; 30 years ago, it was only two-thirds higher (Gould, 2018). In fact, over the long run, if one estimates the lifetime earnings of college graduates and subtracts the costs of going to college, the benefits outweigh the costs by a half million dollars on average (Autor, 2014).</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_248" title="248"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A college education also pays off in terms of wealth. The median net worth of households headed by someone with a bachelor’s degree was $163,700 in 2016, compared to $38,900 for households headed by someone with only a high school diploma (Eggleston and Hays, 2019). For households headed by high school dropouts, the difference is even more pronounced; the median net worth is $4,900. While a few exceptional individuals may drop out of college and go on to become billionaires (Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Apple’s Steve Jobs, and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg come to mind), the chances of following in their footsteps is about as likely as becoming a billionaire rock star or professional athlete. Importantly, if you start college, it pays to finish your degree: The median net worth of households headed by someone who dropped out of college is the same as for those headed by someone with a high school diploma (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2017f).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Of course, it matters which college you go to, what you major in, how much student loan debt you accumulate along the way, and—perhaps above all—the effort you put into your educational experience. While college graduates earn an average of $1 million more than high school graduates over the course of their careers, earnings vary widely by major. A recent study by the Center on Education and Workforce at Georgetown University compared 137 college majors and found that petroleum engineering students have the highest average annual salary, $176,000, while vocational rehabilitation majors earn the least, at $42,300 per year (Payscale, 2019),</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Racial differences in levels of education also persist, which partly explains why racial differences in income and wealth persist as well. In 2016–2017, the highest high school graduation rates were among Asian Americans (91 percent), followed by Whites (87 percent), Hispanics (80 percent), Blacks (78 percent), and Native Americans (72 percent) (NCES, 2019b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Importantly, as we will see later in this chapter, how much education one receives is often influenced by the social class of one’s parents.</p>
</section>
<section id="occupation">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_4">Occupation</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the United States and other industrialized societies, occupation is an important indicator of social standing. According to studies in which people rate jobs in terms of how “prestigious” they are, those requiring the most education are often—but not always—ranked most highly (Table 8.1). The top-ranked occupations appear to share one of two characteristics: They require a fair amount of either education or public service. These rankings have been fairly consistent for nearly four decades (Griswold, 2014). There are some interesting differences by age, however. Millennials seem more inclined than older Americans to value fame: Professional athletes, actors, and entertainers move up in the rankings (Harris, 2014).</p>
</section>
<section id="lifestyle">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_5">Lifestyle</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In analyzing class location, sociologists have traditionally relied on measures that are primarily economic, such as income or wealth. Some recent authors, however, seek to include cultural factors such as lifestyle and consumption patterns. According to this perspective, symbols and markers related to consumption are playing an ever-greater role in daily life. Individual identities are structured more around lifestyle choices—how to dress, what to eat, how to care for one’s body, and where to relax—and less around traditional class indicators such as employment.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu saw social-class groups as identifiable according to their levels of “cultural and economic capital” (Bourdieu, 1984). Increasingly, individuals distinguish themselves not according to economic or occupational factors but on the basis of cultural tastes and leisure pursuits. Consider the growth in occupations related to convincing consumers that true happiness requires looking a certain way, buying a specific product, or being loyal to a particular brand. Advertisers, marketers, fashion designers, style consultants, interior designers, personal trainers, and webpage designers, to name but a few, are all involved in influencing cultural tastes and promoting lifestyle choices.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It would be difficult to dispute that stratification within classes, as well as among classes, now depends not only on occupational differences but also on differences in <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_250" title="250"></span>consumption and lifestyle. The rapid expansion of the service economy and the entertainment and leisure industry, for example, reflects an increasing emphasis on consumption within industrialized countries. Modern societies have become consumer societies, and, in some respects, a consumer society is a “mass society” where class differences are overridden; thus, people from different class backgrounds may all watch similar television programs or shop for clothing in the same stores. Yet class differences can also become intensified through variations in lifestyle and “taste” (Bourdieu, 1984).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Despite the importance of cultural capital in signifying class, we must not ignore the critical role of economic factors in the reproduction of social inequalities. For the most part, individuals experiencing extreme social and material deprivations are not doing so as part of a lifestyle choice. Rather, their circumstances are constrained by factors related to the economic and occupational structure (Rank, Yoon, and Hirschl, 2003). Some Americans may not “choose” to buy clothes at Walmart and eat at McDonald’s; they may simply be unable to afford to shop at higher-end stores and dine at gourmet restaurants.</p>
