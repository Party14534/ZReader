<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When common features of human behavior are found in virtually all societies, they are called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-cultural-universals" href="part0023_split_004.html#cultural-universals">cultural universals</a>. Among the cultural characteristics shared by all societies, two in particular stand out. All cultures incorporate ways of communicating and expressing meaning, and all cultures depend on material objects in daily life. There is no known culture without a grammatically complex language, or which lacks physical objects that share common cultural meanings. Additionally, all cultures possess some recognizable form of family system in which there are values and norms associated with the care of children. The institution of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-marriage" href="part0023_split_004.html#marriage">marriage</a> is a cultural universal, as are religious rituals and property rights—although what constitutes marriage, how many spouses one is entitled to, and what is considered acceptable behavior both within and outside the marriage can vary considerably from culture to culture. All cultures also practice some form of incest prohibition—the banning of sexual relations between close relatives. Other cultural universals include art, dance, bodily adornment, games, gift-giving, joking, and rules of hygiene.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Variations clearly exist within each category. Consider the prohibition against incest. Most often, incest is regarded as sexual relations between members of the immediate family, but among some peoples, it includes cousins and, in some instances, all people bearing the same family name. There have also been societies in which a small proportion of the population engages in incestuous practices. This practice was the case within the ruling class of ancient Egypt, when brothers and sisters were permitted to have sex with each other.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists and anthropologists distinguish between two forms of culture: <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-nonmaterial-culture" href="part0023_split_004.html#nonmaterial-culture">nonmaterial culture</a>, the cultural ideas that are not themselves physical objects, and <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-material-culture" href="part0023_split_004.html#material-culture">material culture</a>, the physical objects that a society creates. We discuss each form of culture in turn.</p>
