<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Charles Horton Cooley and the Looking-Glass Self</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Charles Horton Cooley was an early-twentieth-century sociologist who studied self-concept, or the ways we view and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_116" title="116"></span>think about ourselves. How do we come to view ourselves as humorous or cranky? Intelligent? Kind-hearted? Cooley argued that the notions we develop about ourselves reflect our interpretations of how others see us. His theory of the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-looking-glass-self" href="part0030_split_007.html#looking-glass-self">looking-glass self</a> proposes that the reactions we elicit in social situations create a mirror in which we see ourselves. For example, if others regularly laugh at our jokes, we may perceive that they view us as funny, and in turn, view ourselves as such. Likewise, if our classmates and teachers praise us for our intelligent remarks in class, we may in turn start to view ourselves as smart.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Over time, mixed empirical evidence has led to reformulations of Cooley’s classic theory. One refinement suggests that individuals take action to bring others around to their own views of themselves, rather than passively accepting what others think of them. For example, a student who sees herself as very intelligent may regularly answer questions in class, in an effort to ensure that her classmates also view her as very intelligent (Yeung and Martin, 2003). In this way, youth are not merely passive recipients but rather active agents in shaping others’ perceptions. Despite critiques and refinements of looking glass self theory, this perspective exemplifies core themes of symbolic interactionism, and sets the groundwork for other theories that underscore the importance of perceptions and negotiations in shaping human behaviors and identities (for example, see labeling theory of deviance in <a href="part0046_split_000.html#1BRPS0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 7</a>).</p>
