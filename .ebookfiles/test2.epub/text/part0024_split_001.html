<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Culture and Change: A “Cultural Turn” in Sociology?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The phrase <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-cultural-turn" href="part0024_split_004.html#cultural-turn">cultural turn</a> describes sociology’s recent emphasis on understanding the role of culture in daily life. One result has been to challenge the assumption that culture rigidly determines our values and behaviors. Instead, the sociologist Ann Swidler (1986) has characterized culture as a “tool kit” from which people select different understandings and behaviors. Thus, some people can choose to dye their hair, wear nose rings, and tattoo their bodies but still accept their parents’ traditional ideas about sexual restraint. Because people participate in many different (and often conflicting) cultures, the tool kit can be quite large and its contents varied (Bourdieu, 1990; Sewell, 1992; Tilly, 1992).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Our cultural tool kits include a variety of “scripts” that we can draw on—and even improvise on—to shape our beliefs, values, and actions. The more appropriate the script is to a particular set of circumstances, the more likely we are to follow it—and recall events that conform to it long after they have occurred (D’Andrade, 1995; DiMaggio, 1997). For example, imagine that you are a woman walking alone in an unfamiliar city late at night and suddenly encounter a male stranger who begins to cross the street toward you, stating as he approaches, “Excuse me, may I ask you a question?” Your choice of cultural script will shape your response. A popular cultural script—honed by film and television entertainment, reality TV, and politicians—is to fear such encounters, especially if you are female (Glassner, 1999). As a result, instead of hearing him out, you quickly turn and head for the safety of a nearby all-night restaurant. Later, when retelling the story, you might recall the stranger as taller and more menacing than he was—traits consistent with American cultural scripts about such encounters.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Now imagine that you are the man in this encounter, perhaps an out-of-town businessman trying to find your hotel in an unfamiliar neighborhood. You see a woman walking on the other side of the street, and as you cross to ask for directions, she turns and disappears into a restaurant. Your experience would be very different from that of the woman: You are concerned about the late hour, worried about being lost, and stunned by her response. Perhaps when you return home you will describe this event as evidence that people in this city are cold and indifferent to strangers.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In studying this case in light of the cultural turn, sociologists would attempt to understand the different cultural scripts involved and why each person might have chosen those scripts. How did physical appearance influence their different experiences? What words were spoken, and what meanings did those words convey? What did the two people’s “body language” communicate? Sociologists would also consider alternative scripts that might have altered the experience of each participant. For example, the woman might have chosen the script of “Good Samaritan,” viewing the approaching stranger as potentially in need of assistance and thereby offering to help. Or the man might have recognized that a lone woman would feel threatened and instead have chosen a less confrontational script—perhaps remaining on his side of the street and beginning with a soft-spoken, “Excuse me, can you please tell me the way to my hotel? I seem to be lost.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The cultural turn in sociology reveals that there is no single “reality” to social encounters and that multiple cultural scripts can play out in any situation. The challenge <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_68" title="68"></span>of sociology is to understand people’s differing realities, the scripts that they follow, and the reasons they choose one set of scripts over another (Bonnell and Hunt, 1999; Chaney, 1994; Glassner, 1999; Hays, 2000; Long, 1997; Seidman, 1997; Sewell, 1999; Smith and West, 2000; Swidler, 2001).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologist Wendy Griswold has identified four elements of any culture that constitute a complex cultural system, which she terms the “cultural diamond,” with the four elements representing the four points of a diamond. These four elements include both material and nonmaterial cultural objects; the creators or producers of cultural objects; the receivers of cultural objects, who don’t just passively accept these objects but rather actively make meaning out of them; and the larger social world, comprising the economic, political, social, and cultural patterns in any particular society. Each of the four elements of the cultural diamond interact with the other three, resulting in six possible linkages that shape a society’s culture. Cultural sociology, as Griswold sees it, is especially concerned with one of the six linkages: that between cultural objects (both material and nonmaterial) and the social world (Griswold, 2013).</p>
