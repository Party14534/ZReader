<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Standardized and IQ tests may seem like simple concepts, but both are complex and potentially controversial. For years, psychologists, geneticists, statisticians, and others have debated whether any single human capability can be called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-intelligence" href="part0103_split_003.html#intelligence">intelligence</a>, and if so, whether it rests on innately determined differences. The term intelligence as it is usually employed is difficult to define because it covers qualities that may be unrelated to each other. We might suppose, for example, that the “purest” form of intelligence is the ability to solve abstract mathematical puzzles. However, people who are very good at such puzzles sometimes show low capabilities in other areas, such as history or art. Scholars today increasingly believe in the existence of multiple forms of intelligence that pertain to different areas, such as art, music, language, interpersonal relations, and spatial skills, to name a few. Some scholars have also argued that <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-emotional-intelligence" href="part0103_split_003.html#emotional-intelligence">emotional intelligence</a>—generally defined as the ability to identify, assess, and control the emotions of oneself or others (Goleman, 1996)—is as important to professional and personal success as is the more intellect-based type (Gardner and Hatch, 1989).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because the concept of intelligence has proven so resistant to definition, some psychologists have proposed (and many educators have by default accepted) that it should simply be regarded as “what the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-iq-intelligence-quotient-" href="part0103_split_003.html#iq-intelligence-quotient-">IQ (intelligence quotient)</a> tests measure.” Most IQ tests consist of a mixture of conceptual and computational problems. The tests are constructed in a way that the average score falls at 100 points: Thus anyone scoring below that number is labeled <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_618" title="618"></span>“below-average intelligence,” while anyone scoring above it is viewed as “above-average intelligence.” Despite the fundamental difficulty of measuring intelligence, IQ tests are widely used in research studies as well as in schools and businesses. Nonetheless, sociologists remain critical and wary of the concept. Researchers have found that IQ is powerfully affected by the socioeconomic resources of one’s parents, thus calling into question the belief that intelligence is “innate” or “inborn” (Fischer et al., 1996). Later in this chapter, we will delve further into the debates surrounding the meaning of, and influences on, intelligence.</p>
