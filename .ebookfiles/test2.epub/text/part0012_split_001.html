<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The work of George Herbert Mead (1863–1931), a philosopher teaching at the University of Chicago, influenced the development of sociological thought, in particular through a perspective called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-symbolic-interactionism" href="part0012_split_007.html#symbolic-interactionism">symbolic interactionism</a>. Mead placed particular importance on the study of language in analyzing the social world. According to him, language allows us to become self-conscious beings aware of our own individuality. The key element in this process is the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-symbol" href="part0012_split_007.html#symbol">symbol</a>, something that stands for something else. For example, the word <i class="italic">tree</i> is a symbol by which we represent the object tree. Once we have mastered such a concept, Mead argued, we can think of a tree even if none is visible. Symbolic thought frees us from being limited in our experience to what we can actually see, hear, or feel.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Unlike animals, according to Mead, human beings live in a richly symbolic universe. This idea applies even to our very sense of self. Each of us is a self-conscious being because we learn to look at ourselves as if from the outside—as others see us. When a child begins to use “I” to refer to that object whom others call “you” (himself or herself), the child is exhibiting the beginnings of self-consciousness.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">All interactions among individuals, symbolic interactionists say, involve an exchange of symbols. When we interact with others, we constantly look for clues to discern what type of behavior is appropriate in the context and interpret what others are up to. Symbolic interactionism directs our attention to <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_20" title="20"></span>the detail of interpersonal interaction and how that detail is used to make sense of what others say and do. For instance, suppose two people are on a first date. Each spends a good part of the evening sizing the other up and assessing how the relationship is likely to develop, if at all. Neither wishes to be seen doing this too openly, although each recognizes that it is going on. Both individuals are careful about their own behavior, being eager to present themselves in a favorable light; but, knowing this, both are looking for aspects of the other’s behavior that reveal his or her true nature. A complex and subtle process of symbolic interpretation shapes their interaction.</p>
