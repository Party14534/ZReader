<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-conflict-theory" href="part0048_split_006.html#conflict-theory">Conflict theory</a> draws on elements of Marxist thought to argue that deviance is deliberate and often political. Conflict theorists deny that deviance is “determined” by factors such as biology, personality, anomie, social <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_208" title="208"></span>disorganization, and labels. Rather, they argue, individuals choose to engage in deviant behavior in response to the inequalities of the capitalist system. Thus, members of countercultural groups regarded as deviant—such as supporters of the Black Power movement or gay liberation movement—are engaging in political acts that challenge the social order. More recently, the Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter protesters were similarly engaging in political acts that challenge the social order.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Conflict theorists analyze crime and deviance in terms of the social structure and the preservation of power among the ruling class. For example, they argue that laws serve the powerful to maintain their privileged positions. These theorists reject the idea that laws are applied evenly across the population. Instead, as inequalities increase between the ruling class and the working class, law becomes the key instrument for the powerful to maintain order. This dynamic is evident in the criminal justice system, which has become increasingly oppressive toward working-class offenders or in tax legislation that disproportionately favors the wealthy. This power imbalance is not restricted to the creation of laws, however. The powerful also break laws, scholars argue, but are rarely caught. On the whole, these crimes are much more significant than the everyday crime and delinquency that attract the most attention. But, fearful of the implications of pursuing white-collar criminals, law enforcement instead targets less powerful members of society such as prostitutes, drug users, and petty thieves (Chambliss, 1988; Pearce, 1976).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Studies by Chambliss, Pearce, and others have played an important role in widening the debate about crime and deviance to include questions of social justice, power, and politics. They emphasize that crime occurs in the context of inequalities and competing interests among social groups.</p>
