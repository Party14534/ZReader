<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">We live in a world today that is increasingly complex. What makes this possible? Why are the conditions of our lives so different from those of earlier times? How will our lives change in the future? To what extent are things that seem natural actually socially constructed? Does the individual matter? These types of questions led to the study of sociology. As you read this text, you will encounter examples from different peopleâ€™s lives that will help answer these important questions.</b></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">In <a href="part0009_split_000.html#8IL20-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 1</a>, we explore the scope of sociology and learn what insights the field can bring, such as the development of a global perspective and an understanding of social change. Sociology is not a body of theories everyone agrees on. As in any complex field, the questions we raise allow for different answers. In this chapter, we compare and contrast differing theoretical traditions.</b></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1"><a href="part0015_split_000.html#E9OE0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 2</a> explores the tools of the trade and considers how sociologists do research. A number of basic methods of investigation are available to explore the social world. We must be sure that the information underlying sociological reasoning is as reliable and accurate as possible. The chapter examines the problems encountered when gathering such information and indicates how best to deal with them.</b></p>
