<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_5">Evaluating Theories of Global Inequality</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Each of the four sets of theories of global inequality has strengths and weaknesses. Together, they enable us to better understand the causes and cures for global inequality.</p>
<ol class="fmnl">
<li class="bcpt" value="1"><b class="bold1">Neoliberal theories recommend the adoption of modern capitalist institutions to promote economic development.</b> <span>They further argue that countries can develop economically only if they open their borders to trade, and they cite evidence to support this argument. But neoliberal theories overlook economic ties between poor countries and wealthy ones—ties that can impede economic growth under some conditions and enhance it under others. They blame low-income countries for their poverty rather than acknowledge outside factors, such as the business operations of more powerful nations. Neoliberal theories also ignore the ways government can work with the private sector to spur <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_304" title="304"></span>economic development. Finally, they fail to explain why some countries take off economically while others remain grounded in poverty and underdevelopment.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="2"><b class="bold1">Dependency theories emphasize how wealthy nations have exploited poor ones.</b> <span>However, although these theories account for much of the economic poverty throughout the world, they cannot explain the occasional success stories, such as the rapidly expanding economies of China and East Asia. In fact, some formerly low-income countries have risen economically despite the presence of multinational corporations. Even some former colonies, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, are among the success stories.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="3"><b class="bold1">World-systems theory analyzes the world economy as a whole, looking at the complex global web of political and economic relationships that influence development and inequality in poor and rich nations alike.</b> <span>Building on the notion of global commodity chains as well as dependency theory, it is well suited to understanding the global economy at a time when businesses are increasingly free to set up operations anywhere, acquiring an economic importance rivaling that of many countries, and where strong states often play a role in fostering economic growth. One challenge faced by world-systems theory lies in the difficulty of modeling a complex and interdependent world economy. It also has been criticized for emphasizing economic and political forces at the expense of cultural ones, such as the combination of nationalism and religious belief that is currently reshaping the Middle East. Finally, world-systems theory has been said to place too much emphasis on the role of nation-states in a world economy increasingly shaped by transnational corporations that operate independently of national borders (Robinson, 2004; Sklair, 2000).</span></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="4"><b class="bold1">The theory of global capitalism emphasizes the importance of an emerging and increasingly powerful transnational capitalist class, which is reshaping the world economy in its interests.</b> <span>This class lacks national loyalty. Rather, its members see themselves as world citizens, sharing similar lifestyles, beliefs, and experiences. The theory of global capitalism argues that this class also dominates the global institutions that oversee and manage the world economy. The power of national capitalists, and the governments that serve their interests, has been severely weakened, as national capitalists are absorbed into the transnational capitalist class. One criticism of this approach is that it overemphasizes the economic and political power of global capitalism, pointing to the power of national business and non-business actors in such countries as China, which have developed a form of national capitalism in which the state plays a highly effective role. It also, like world-systems theory, downplays the ongoing importance of nationalism and religious belief in world politics.</span></li>
