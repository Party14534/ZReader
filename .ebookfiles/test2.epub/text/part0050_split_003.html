<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">If you went about life knowing that a camera would record all your activities, would this knowledge encourage you to be a better rule follower? How about at work? Would it encourage you to do your job better, or to act in a more ethical manner? City officials in Oakland, California, and New York City seem to think so. In 2011, the Oakland police department mandated that its officers work with cameras attached to their <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_230" title="230"></span>bodies to document arrests and traffic stops (Goode, 2011). Similarly, the tragic death of Eric Garner in 2014 at the hands of New York City police officers led New York’s public to call for the use of body cameras for the NYPD (James, 2014; Glenza, 2011). In both cases, officials hope that body cameras will hold police accountable for their actions, address citizen concerns about abuse of power, and encourage more consistent adherence to codes of police behavior.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">To sociologists, these cases raise a broader question about the relationship between deviance and privacy. In the absence of privacy—the assurance that you can go about your life without having a record of all your actions—is it possible to be anything <i class="italic">but</i> a rule follower? Further, if everyone is a rule follower, does this lead to a safer or more equitable society?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Based on our earlier discussions of crime prevention, you might be tempted to conclude that societies are always better off when people follow the rules. However, in some cases, not complying with the rules may facilitate social interactions, reduce power inequalities, or enable positive social change. Consider as an example social movements like the Arab Spring, where defiance of the law enabled individuals to demand democracy and respect for human rights. If constant government surveillance made it impossible for these individuals to break rules and engage in politically subversive acts, democratic movements in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and elsewhere may have never occurred.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_231" title="231"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">You might also think back to the example used in the introduction of this chapter in which Mafia members broke the law to enter into mainstream society. If the police had access to a detailed record of all criminal activities linked to the Lupollo clan, the family may never have succeeded in becoming respectable. For the Lupollos, strict adherence to the rules might have offered fewer opportunities for upward mobility.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Finally, in everyday life, think about the role of white lies, or lies by omission, when speaking with someone you have only just met. On first dates, or meetings with potential employers—where stakes of the interaction are high—we may smooth social interactions by obscuring or selectively revealing the truth. In many ways, falsehoods and deviance from normative behavior are important in social life, helping us navigate new, complex social situations (Levy, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This discussion is particularly relevant in the context of recent revelations of surveillance and wiretapping conducted by the National Security Agency and other state bodies. Even data collection by private firms like Facebook and Google have raised new concerns about a citizen’s right to privacy in the contemporary age. If the government and large corporations have the ability to track your movements, what you say online, and even what you say to close friends and family, is it still possible to be a rule breaker and deviate from norms in ways that may be conducive to social life?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">On the one hand, new technologies can lead to what some legal scholars have referred to as “gap closure”—or the more thorough enforcement of laws regulating our conduct. Instead of hiring a police officer to watch an intersection all day and ticket people who run red lights, it may be more efficient to install a camera that can impartially capture all the rule breakers. The absence of human bias in law enforcement could lead to a more exact correspondence between laws and intended behaviors. However, as we have noted, the imperfect realization of certain norms may actually serve important social functions. What’s more, “closing” the gap between certain rules and social expectations may lead to the rise of new gaps, perhaps in the ways that we interface with technologies or circumvent them to go about our lives (Levy, 2014).</p>
