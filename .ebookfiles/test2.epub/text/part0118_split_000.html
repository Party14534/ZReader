<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Life expectancy for people in most parts of the world increased steadily over the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Infectious diseases such as polio, scarlet fever, and diphtheria have been largely eradicated. In wealthy and industrialized nations infant mortality rates have dropped precipitously, leading to an increase in the average age of death in the developed world. Compared with other parts of the world, standards of physical health and well-being are high. Many advances in public health have been attributed to the power of modern medicine. It is commonly assumed that medical research has been, and will continue to be, successful in uncovering the biological causes of disease and developing effective treatments. At the same time, however, the proportion reporting mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety disorders, has increased steeply through the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, raising new questions about how we define, detect, and diagnose mental health conditions (Greenberg, 2010; Horwitz, 2013).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While sociologists recognize that, on average, physical health and risk of mortality have improved and mental health has, by some accounts, declined in the past century, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_728" title="728"></span>these patterns vary widely throughout the population both within the United States and across the globe. Research has shown that certain groups of people enjoy much better health than others. These health inequalities appear to reflect larger systems of social stratification, including race, gender, and social class stratification. From 2015 to 2017, the United States witnessed three consecutive years of declining life expectancy, a stunning development after a half century of improvements in life expectancy. A close look at the data show that shortening life spans overall were a function of health conditions that were particularly devastating to economically disadvantaged adults, most notably middle-aged high school dropouts who had high rates of “deaths of despair” including suicides and deaths related to opioid addiction (Case and Deaton, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Deaths from COVID-19 also follow stark social patterns. As of July 2020, it was too soon to tell how the pandemic would affect overall life expectancy in the United States, but one fact is clear: COVID-19 deaths, like deaths of despair, disproportionately strike economically disadvantaged persons who live in crowded housing and work in jobs that place them at risk, like bus drivers or grocery store clerks. One examination of New York City found that the Bronx—the borough with the highest proportion of racial and ethnic minorities, the most persons living in poverty, and lowest levels of educational attainment—had higher rates of hospitalization and death related to COVID-19 than all other boroughs (Wadhera et al., 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Understanding the distribution and incidence of disease and illness within a population is the primary goal of the field of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-epidemiology" href="part0118_split_005.html#epidemiology">epidemiology</a>—the science that studies the distribution and incidence of disease and illness within the population. Epidemiologists attempt to explain the link between physical and mental health and variables such as social class, gender, race, age, and geography. While most scholars acknowledge the strong positive correlation between socioeconomic resources and good health, they do not agree about the nature of the connection or how to address health inequalities. One of the main areas of debate involves the relative importance of individual variables (e.g., lifestyle, behavior, diet, stress, and cultural patterns) versus environmental or structural factors (e.g., income distribution, poverty, and access to health care).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In this section, we examine cutting-edge research on health patterns in the United States according to social class, gender, and race, and we review some competing explanations for the persistence of those patterns. We also discuss current research on how society and culture influence sexual practices and attitudes, with a particular focus on the changing acceptance of same-sex sexual relations. We conclude by highlighting the ways our bodies—something we think of as “natural”—are increasingly shaped and affected by a further aspect of the macrosocial context: science and technology.</p>
