<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">The Research Process</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In order to understand the way sociology asks and answers questions, it is helpful to think of the research it does as a process. We can better understand the main concepts of research design by breaking down the process into seven stages of research, beginning with the definition of a research question and ending with the dissemination of the study findings.</p>
<section id="define-the-research-problem">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">1. Define the Research Problem</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">All research starts with a research problem. This problem may be an area of factual ignorance about, say, certain institutions, social processes, or cultures. A researcher might seek to answer questions such as: What proportion of the population holds strong religious <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_35" title="35"></span>beliefs? Are people today disaffected with “big government”? How far does the economic position of women lag behind that of men? Do LGBTQ and straight teens differ in their levels of self-esteem?</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">In looking at this painting by Brueghel, we can observe the number of people, what each is doing, and the style of the buildings. But without the title, <i class="italic">Netherlandish Proverbs,</i> these facts tell us nothing about the picture’s meaning. In the same way, sociologists need theory as a context for their observations.</figcaption>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The best sociological research begins with problems that are also puzzles. A puzzle arises not simply from a lack of information but also from a gap in our understanding. Much of the skill in producing worthwhile sociological research consists in correctly identifying puzzles.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Rather than just answering the question “What is going on here?” skilled researchers try to illuminate why events happen as they do. Thus, we might ask, Why are patterns of religious belief changing? What accounts for the recent decline in the proportion of the population voting in presidential elections? Why are women poorly represented in science and technology jobs? What are the characteristics of high schools with high levels of bullying?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">No piece of research stands alone. One project may lead to another because it raises issues the researcher had not previously considered. A sociologist may discover puzzles by reading the work of other researchers in books and professional journals or by being aware of social trends. For example, an increasing number of public health programs have sought to treat the mentally ill while they continue to live in the community rather than confining them in asylums. Sociologists might be prompted to ask, What has caused this shift in attitude toward the mentally ill? What are the likely consequences for the patients themselves and for the rest of the community?</p>
</section>
<section id="review-the-literature">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">2. Review the Literature</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Once a research problem is identified, the sociologist must review related research: Have previous researchers spotted the same puzzle? How have they tried to solve it? What aspects of the problem has their research left unanalyzed? Have they looked only at small segments of the population, such as one age group, gender, or region? Drawing on others’ ideas helps the sociologist clarify the relevant issues and the appropriate research methods.</p>
</section>
<section id="make-the-problem-precise">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">3. Make the Problem Precise</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A third stage involves clearly formulating the research problem. If relevant literature already exists, the researcher may have a good idea of how to approach the problem. At this stage, hunches sometimes become <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-hypotheses" href="part0016_split_002.html#hypotheses">hypotheses</a>—educated guesses about what is going on. For the research to be effective, the researcher must formulate a hypothesis in such a way that the factual material gathered will provide evidence either supporting or disproving it.</p>
</section>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_36" title="36"></span>
<section id="work-out-a-design">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_4">4. Work Out a Design</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The researcher then decides how to collect the research materials, choosing from a range of methods based on the study objectives as well as the aspects of behavior under study. For some purposes, a survey (usually involving questionnaires) might be suitable. In other circumstances, interviews or an observational study might be appropriate.</p>
</section>
<section id="carry-out-the-research">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_5">5. Carry Out the Research</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Researchers then proceed to carry out the plan developed in step 4. However, during the actual research, unforeseen practical difficulties may arise that force the researcher to rethink his or her initial strategy. For example, it might prove impossible to contact certain questionnaire recipients or interview subjects. A business firm or government agency might not let the researcher carry out the work as planned. Yet omitting such persons or institutions from the study could bias the results, creating an inaccurate or incomplete picture of social reality. For instance, a researcher studying how business corporations have complied with affirmative action programs might find that companies that have not complied do not wish to be studied.</p>
</section>
<section id="interpret-the-results">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_6">6. Interpret the Results</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Once the information has been gathered, the researcher’s work is not over—it is just beginning! The researcher must analyze the data, track trends, and test hypotheses. Most important, researchers must interpret their results in such a way that they tell a clear story and directly address the research puzzle outlined in step 1. Although it may be possible to reach clear answers to the initial questions, many investigations are ultimately not fully conclusive.</p>
</section>
<section id="report-the-findings">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_7">7. Report the Findings</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The research report, usually published as a journal article or book, provides an account of the research question, methods, findings, and the implications of the findings for social theory, public policy, or practice. This stage is only final in terms of the individual project. Most reports identify unanswered questions and suggest new questions for further research. All individual research investigations are part of the continuing process of research within the sociological community.</p>
</section>
<section id="reality-intrudes">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_8">Reality Intrudes!</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The preceding sequence of steps is a simplified version of what happens in actual research projects. These stages rarely succeed each other so neatly; the difference is like that between the recipes outlined in a cookbook and the actual process of preparing a meal: Deviations can sometimes be necessary and beneficial. Experienced cooks often don’t work from recipes at all, yet they might cook better meals than those <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_37" title="37"></span>who do. Following fixed schemes can be unduly restricting; much outstanding sociological research would not fit rigidly into this sequence, though it would include most of the steps outlined here.</p>
