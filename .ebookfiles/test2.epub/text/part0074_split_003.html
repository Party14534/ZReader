<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The wars of conquest that created the boundaries of the contemporary United States were directed not only against the Native American population but also against Mexico. The territory that later became California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah—along with its quarter of a million Mexicans—was taken by the United States in 1848 as a result of the American war with Mexico. The terms <i class="italic">Mexican American</i> and <i class="italic">Chicano</i> refer to the descendants of these people, together with subsequent immigrants from Mexico. The term <i class="italic">Latino</i> refers to people descended from Latin America, while <i class="italic">Hispanic</i> tends to refer to anyone living in the United States descended from Spanish-speaking regions.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The four main groups of Hispanics in the United States come from Mexico (around 36.6 million), Puerto Rico (5.3 million), El Salvador (3.8 million), and Cuba (3.7 million). A further 10.4 million Spanish-speaking residents are from countries in Central and South America and other Hispanic or Latino regions (Stepler and Brown, 2016). California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Illinois have the largest Hispanic populations, accounting for nearly two-thirds of all Hispanics (Stepler and Lopez, 2016). In 2016, the more than 60 million Hispanics in the United States represented nearly 18.3 percent of the population—up from 4.7 percent in 1970 and 12.5 percent in 2000. However, the growth of the Hispanic population has slowed in recent years due to a decrease in immigration as well as declining birth rates among Hispanic women in the United States (Krogstad, 2016).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Mexican Americans</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Mexican Americans reside mainly in California, Texas, and other southwestern states, although there are substantial groups in the Midwest and Northern cities as well. The majority work at low-paying jobs. In the post–World War II period up to the early 1960s, Mexican workers were admitted without much restriction. This period was succeeded by a phase of quotas on legal immigrants and deportations of undocumented immigrants. Today, undocumented immigrants continue to cross the border illegally. In 2016, there were an estimated 5.6 million unauthorized Mexican immigrants living in the United States, accounting for about half of all unauthorized immigrants <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_395" title="395"></span>(Krogstad, Passel, and Cohn, 2017). Large numbers are intercepted and sent back each year, but most simply try again.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because Mexico is a relatively poor neighbor of the wealthy United States, this flow of people northward is unlikely to cease. Undocumented immigrants can be employed more cheaply than indigenous workers, and they perform jobs that most of the rest of the population would not accept. Legislation passed by Congress in 1986 has enabled unauthorized immigrants living in the United States for at least five years to claim legal residence. In the past decade, however, immigration from Mexico has decreased. More Mexicans have left the United States than entered the country since the Great Recession ended (Gonzalez-Barrera, 2015).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Mexicans in the United States typically have levels of economic well-being and educational attainment far below that of native-born Americans. In 2017, 20 percent of Mexicans lived in poverty. More than two-thirds (71 percent) of Mexicans in the United States are proficient in English; however, only 12 percent hold bachelor’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_396" title="396"></span>degrees (Noe-Bustamante, Flores, and Shah, 2019b). Many Mexican Americans resist assimilation into the dominant English-speaking culture and increasingly display pride in their own cultural identity within the United States. Social scientists estimate that Mexican immigrants and their children may become increasingly assimilated into life in the United States in coming decades, due in part to policies that help them obtain an affordable college education. Given that about half of undocumented immigrants in the United States hail from Mexico, these policies will have a major impact on the lives of young Mexican immigrants.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Puerto Ricans and Cubans</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States through war, and Puerto Ricans have been American citizens since 1917. The island is poor, and many of its inhabitants have migrated to the mainland United States to seek a better life. Puerto Ricans who emigrated originally settled primarily in New York City, but since the 1960s, they have also settled elsewhere. A reverse migration of Puerto Ricans back to the island began in the 1970s. In recent years, however, record numbers of Puerto Ricans have been migrating to the United States to escape the island’s decade-long recession (Krogstad, Starr, and Sandstrom, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the most important issues facing Puerto Rican activists is the political destiny of their homeland. Puerto Rico is a commonwealth, not a full state. For years, Puerto Ricans have been divided about whether the island should retain its present status, opt for independence, or attempt to become the 51st state of the Union. In June 2017, 97 percent of Puerto Ricans voted in favor of statehood in a nonbinding referendum; however, less than a quarter of registered voters actually cast ballots due to boycotts. The vote came just a few weeks after the country declared a form of bankruptcy (Robles, 2017). This is the fifth time Puerto Ricans have voted on the issue of statehood. In a 2012 vote in which nearly 78 percent of Puerto Ricans cast ballots, a majority of 54 percent voted in favor of statehood.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A third Hispanic group, the Cubans, differs from the others in key respects. Cubans in the United States tend to be more successful compared to other U.S. Hispanic groups: 27 percent of Cubans ages 25 and older have at least a bachelor’s degree (compared to 16 percent of all U.S. Hispanics), median annual earnings for Cubans is $28,000 (versus $25,000), and 16 percent live in poverty (versus 19 percent) (Noe-Bustamante, Flores, and Shah, 2019b). Half a million Cubans fled communism after the rise of Fidel Castro in 1959, and the majority of these settled in Florida. Unlike other Latino immigrants, most were educated people from white-collar and professional backgrounds. They have thrived within the United States, many finding positions comparable to those they abandoned in Cuba. As a group, Cubans have the highest family income of all Latinos.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A further wave of Cuban immigrants of less-affluent origin arrived in 1980 and live in circumstances closer to the rest of the Latino communities in the United States. Both sets of Cuban immigrants are mainly political refugees rather than economic migrants. The later immigrants have become the “working class” for the earlier immigrants. They are paid low wages, but Cuban employers hire them in preference to other ethnic groups.</p>
