<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Are Single People Less Happy than Married People?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The broad category of “single” encompasses both people who have never married and those who have married but are now single due to divorce, separation, or widowhood. The number of people living alone in U.S. society has increased dramatically in recent decades. Several factors have combined to create this trend. First, people are marrying later than ever. That means that more people in their twenties, thirties, and even forties are living alone, waiting for the “right one” to come along. Second, the rise and stabilization of divorce rates over the past half century mean that many more people are living on their own when their marriage ends. Third, the “graying” of the U.S. population (see <a href="part0077_split_000.html#29DRA0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 12</a>) is accompanied by growing numbers of older adults whose partners have died and who now live alone as widows and widowers, as well as rising numbers of persons who divorce in later life and prefer not to repartner. Fourth, the “stigma” of being single has diminished, due in part to television shows such as <i class="italic">Sex and the City</i>, which glamorized the lifestyles of “single and fabulous” women. As such, many more Americans are happily choosing to live their lives on their own (Byrne and Carr, 2005; Klinenberg, 2012a).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet are people really happy on their own, or are they better off being married? A large body of literature dating back to Émile Durkheim’s classic <i class="italic">Suicide</i> (1966; orig. 1897) argues that social ties, especially marriage and parenthood, are essential to one’s physical, social, and emotional well-being. Recent contemporary studies also show <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_609" title="609"></span>that divorced and widowed people report more sickness, depression, and anxiety compared with their married counterparts, although much of this disadvantage reflects the strains that precede a marital transition (such as a spouse’s illness or marital strife), as well as the strains that follow from the dissolution, such as financial worries or legal battles (Carr and Springer, 2010).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">But what about people who are long-term singles or who choose to live alone without a spouse or partner? To date, these individuals are relatively rare; more than 90 percent of American adults do ultimately marry. However, researchers have projected that as many as one in five Millennials will never marry. Many reasons are given, including the four reasons cited in this section’s opening paragraph. Millennials (those born in the 1980s and thereafter) are particularly likely to face financial obstacles to marry, given their high levels of unemployment, school debt, and tendency to live with their parents rather than on their own when in their twenties (Wang and Parker, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet is life-long singlehood a bad thing? Are singles’ lives marked by loneliness and desolate evenings at home eating frozen dinners alone? Research by sociologist Eric Klinenberg (2012a) and others finds that living alone can “promote freedom, personal control, and self-realization—all prized aspects of contemporary life” (Klinenberg, 2012b). After interviewing more than 300 people who live alone, he found that they had more rather than less social interaction than their married counterparts, and much of their social interactions were those they sought out by choice: encounters with friends, volunteering, arts events, classes, and other meetings that rounded out their lives. These patterns hold among older adults and younger adults alike. As Klinenberg observed, for many people, living alone and being able to choose how and with whom they spend their time is a sought-after luxury.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Taken together, research showing that people who live alone (by choice) are no better or worse off than their partnered peers underscores one of the core themes of sociology of families: There is no one “best” or “typical” way in which Americans arrange their social lives. Rather, the freedom to choose one’s relationships is essential to one’s happiness.</p>
