<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Like most sociologists in the twentieth century, the Chicago School researchers were professors who saw their mission as contributing to a scholarly literature and advancing the field of social science. At certain moments in the history of sociology, however, advances have also come from thinkers working outside universities without formal training in sociology. One such person was Jane Jacobs, who published <i class="italic">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</i> in 1961, and who emerged as a highly influential public intellectual who helped shape the field of urban studies.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Jacobs, like Wirth, noted that “cities are, by definition, full of strangers,” some of whom are dangerous. She then tried to explain what makes it possible for cities to meet <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_774" title="774"></span>the challenge of “assimilating strangers” in such a way that strangers can feel comfortable together. She argued that cities are most habitable when they feature a diversity of uses, thereby ensuring that many people will be coming and going on the streets at any time. When enough people are out and about, Jacobs wrote, “respectable” eyes and ears dominate the street and are fixed on strangers, who will thus not get out of hand. Underneath the seeming disorder of a busy street is the very basis for order in “the intricacy of sidewalk use, bringing with it a constant succession of eyes.” The more people who are out, or looking from their windows at the people who are out, the more their gazes will safeguard the street.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">More than five decades after her book was published, Jacobs’s ideas remain extremely influential. Yet times have changed since Jacobs’s writing, and a great diversity of people are now found on city sidewalks, often representing economic inequalities, cultural differences, and extremes of behavior. From the homeless seeking a few dollars, to the mentally ill who have no other place to go, sidewalk life can often seem unpredictable and threatening (Duneier, 1999). Under these conditions, strangers do not necessarily feel the kind of solidarity and mutual assurance she described. Sociologists today must ask: What happens to urban life when “the eyes and ears upon the street” represent vast inequalities and cultural differences? Under what conditions do the assumptions Jacobs made still hold up?</p>
