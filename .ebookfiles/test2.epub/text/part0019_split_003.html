<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Can We Really Study Human Social Life in a Scientific Way?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">To answer this question, we must first understand what <i class="italic">science</i> means. Science is the use of systematic methods of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-empirical-investigation" href="part0019_split_004.html#empirical-investigation">empirical investigation</a>, the analysis of data, theoretical thinking, and the logical assessment of arguments to develop a body of knowledge about specific subject matter. According to this definition, sociology is a scientific endeavor.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">However, sociology is not equivalent to a natural science. Unlike natural phenomena and animals, humans are self-aware beings who confer sense and purpose to what they <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_51" title="51"></span>do. We can’t describe social life accurately unless we grasp the concepts that people apply in their own behavior. For instance, to describe a death as a suicide means knowing what the person intended when he died. Suicide can occur only when an individual has self-destruction actively in mind. If he accidentally steps in front of a car and is killed, he cannot be said to have committed suicide.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The fact that we cannot study human beings in the same way as we can study objects in nature is an advantage to sociological researchers, who profit from being able to pose questions directly to those they study: other human beings. In other respects, sociology encounters difficulties not present in the natural sciences. People who are aware that their activities are being scrutinized may not behave normally; they may consciously or unconsciously portray themselves in a way that differs from their usual attitudes. They may even try to “assist” the researcher by giving the responses they believe she wants.</p>
