<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Changing Conceptions of Health, Illness, and Medicine</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What does it mean to be “healthy”? The simplest and most widely accepted definition is the one provided by the World Health Organization (1948): “<a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-health" href="part0116_split_003.html#health">Health</a> is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” In practice, however, cultures differ in what they consider healthy and in what they see as appropriate “treatment” for ill health. All cultures have known concepts of physical and mental health and illness, but most of what we now recognize as medicine is a consequence of developments in Western society over the past three centuries.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In premodern cultures, the family was the main institution for coping with sickness or affliction. There have always been individuals who specialized as healers, using a mixture of physical and magical remedies, and many such traditional systems survive today in non-Western cultures. For instance, Ayurvedic medicine (traditional healing) has been practiced in India for nearly 2,000 years. It is founded on a theory of the equilibrium of psychological and physical facets of the personality, imbalances of which are treated by nutritional and herbal remedies. Chinese folk medicine similarly aims <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_712" title="712"></span>to restore harmony among aspects of the personality and bodily systems and involves the use of herbs and acupuncture for treatment.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Modern medicine sees the origins and treatment of disease as physical and explicable in scientific terms. Indeed, the application of science to medical diagnosis and cure underlay the development of modern health care systems. Sociologists have argued that in contemporary Western societies, conditions that were previously viewed as having their roots in social, cultural, or religious causes are now “medicalized,” or viewed as biomedical in their roots. Medicalization, according to sociologist Peter Conrad, is the process by which conditions and problems of social life become defined and treated as medical conditions, and thus become the subject of medical study, diagnosis, prevention, or treatment (Conrad, 2007). The medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth, for example, developed slowly as obstetric specialists replaced local physicians and midwives. In industrialized societies, most births today occur in a hospital, with the help of a specialized medical team.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It’s not just physical health conditions that are medicalized; our emotions and mental health also are medicalized. Sociologist Allan Horwitz has argued that in the United States, the emotion of “sadness,” a normal response to stressors like loss, failure, and disappointment, has now been transformed into the medical disorder of “depression,” which is believed to have its roots in biological causes such as brain chemistry or genetics (Horwitz and Wakefield, 2007). As such, depressed persons today are much more likely to be treated with medications, such as antidepressants, rather than “talk therapy,” in which a therapist would focus on the social or emotional roots of the sad feelings. Medicalization is tightly linked to the economic organization of medical care. Patients are reimbursed by their health insurers for treatments only when they have a <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_713" title="713"></span>definable medical condition; as Horwitz and Wakefield (2007) note, a physician could not easily find a reimbursable “code” for sadness, but many options are available for a patient presenting at a doctor’s office with “depression” (Moore, 2004).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Other features of modern medicine are the acceptance of the hospital as the setting within which to treat serious illnesses and the development of the medical profession as a body with codes of ethics and significant social power. The scientific view of disease is linked to the requirement that medical training be systematic and long-term; self-taught healers are typically excluded. Although professional medical practice is not limited to hospitals, the hospital has provided an environment in which doctors can treat and study large numbers of patients in circumstances permitting the concentration of medical technology.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">A tragic clash between spiritual beliefs and modern medicine is the focus of Anne Fadiman’s account of an epileptic Hmong girl in <i class="italic">The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down</i>.</figcaption>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">On rare occasions, tensions may arise when physicians adhere to modern medical models and their patients adhere to folk or spiritual models of health. These cultural tensions are portrayed poignantly in the book <i class="italic">The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures</i> (Fadiman, 1997). The book recounts the experience of the Lee family, ethnic Hmong immigrants from Laos, whose infant daughter had epilepsy. The Lees believed their daughter’s illness stemmed from spiritual causes, while doctors believed the condition was biological and could be alleviated with anticonvulsive drugs. After trying to comply with a difficult medication regimen, the Lees stopped administering the drugs, and their daughter was placed in foster care, with tragic results.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Just as cultural beliefs about health and illness change across time and place, the very illnesses from which individuals suffer, and the causes and cures of these illnesses, vary widely by sociohistorical context. In medieval times, the major illnesses were infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, cholera, malaria, and bubonic plague. In the fourteenth century, the epidemic of the plague, also referred to as the Black Death, killed a quarter of the population of England and devastated large areas of Europe. Since that time, rates of infectious diseases declined dramatically and were a minor cause of death in <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_714" title="714"></span>industrialized countries, accounting for just 6 percent of deaths annually in the 2010s (Xu et al., 2020). Infectious diseases had given way to noninfectious diseases such as cancer and heart disease as the leading causes of death. However, the assumption that infectious diseases were a thing of the past was challenged in early 2020, when the coronavirus struck China and Italy, and the United States shortly thereafter. As of July 2020, over 130,000 persons in the United States and over 560,000 worldwide had died of the virus (CDC COVID-19 Response Team, 2020b; WHO, 2020d).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although in premodern societies the highest rates of death were among infants and young children, death rates today (the proportion of the population who die each year) rise with increasing age. The leading causes of death today, heart disease and cancer, disproportionately strike persons age 65 and older. While infectious diseases can strike anyone today, just as they did during past centuries, older adults are especially vulnerable to coronavirus. According to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control, roughly 80 percent of all people who died of the COVID-19 virus in early 2020 were age 65 and over (CDC COVID-19 Response Team, 2020b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When sociologists take a long-term view of health, they have found that improvements in medical care accounted for only a minor part of the decline in death rates before the twentieth century. Effective sanitation, better nutrition, water purification, milk pasteurization, control of sewage, and improved hygiene were more consequential (Dowling, 1977). Drugs, advances in surgery, and antibiotics did not significantly decrease death rates until well into the twentieth century. Antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections first became available in the 1930s and 1940s; most immunizations (against diseases such as polio) were developed later.</p>
