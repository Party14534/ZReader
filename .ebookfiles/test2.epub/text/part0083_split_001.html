<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Every year, an organization called Freedom House (2019) classifies countries as either “free,” “partly free,” or “not free” based on a country-by-country survey of political rights (including open and fair elections, a multiparty system, and the absence of governmental corruption) and civil liberties (including freedom of expression and association, the rule of law, and individual rights). By these measures, in 2019, less than half the world’s population (44 percent) lived in countries that were classified as “free”; 30 percent of the global population lived in countries that were classified as “partly free,” while the rest of the population—numbering some 1.9 billion people living in 49 countries, or 26 percent of the world’s total—was classified as “not free.” Freedom House reports that on some measures, the percentage of people who would be classified as “free” has increased in recent years. For example, in 1986, only 34 percent of the countries surveyed were classified as free; by 2019, as noted, the figure had increased to 44 percent. But the major gains resulted when India was reclassified from “partly free” to “free,” which added nearly a billion people to the “free” category.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This points out one of the principal limitations of such broad-stroke classifications: Although India now formally enjoys a wide range of political rights and civil liberties and a growing economy and middle class, as many as a half billion people in India still live in grinding poverty. Freedom House also classifies India’s press and Internet as only “partly free.” Whatever freedoms Indians may have on paper are severely limited by economic hardship and corrupt or indifferent local officials, a situation that has contributed to widespread discontent, protests, and an increasingly authoritarian government (Chandra, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">To take an example closer to home, candidates for the 2016 U.S. elections and their supporters are estimated to have spent nearly $6.5 billion on the presidential race and congressional campaigns, suggesting that extremely wealthy individuals, large corporations, organized labor, and lobbying groups have an enormous ability to shape electoral outcomes to reflect their interests (Link, 2017). Moreover, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_455" title="455"></span>any trend toward greater freedom is not irreversible: Since 2004, freedom has significantly declined in Russia and the former Soviet states in Central Europe (Freedom House, 2019; Shkolnikov, 2010).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What difference does it make whether a country is free? The answer is that it clearly matters how the decisions are made that affect its citizens’ lives. Furthermore, most people (and their governments) at least profess to believe that people should enjoy basic political and social freedoms. The second paragraph of the Declaration of Independence famously says, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . . . That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Is greater freedom spreading around the world? Is the idea of freedom contagious, as some have suggested? Before turning to theories and research that address this issue, it is first necessary to define some basic concepts.</p>
