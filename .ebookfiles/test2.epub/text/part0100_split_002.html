<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Alongside the increase in same-sex marriage, same-sex couples are forming families with children in unprecedented numbers. Sixteen percent of same-sex-couple households include children, out of which, 8.1 percent of same-sex male couples and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_607" title="607"></span>over 24 percent of same-sex female couples raised children between 2014 and 2016 (Goldberg and Conron, 2018). According to the Williams Institute, an estimated 37 percent of LGBTQ-identified persons have been a parent, and an estimated 6 million children in the United States have lived with a gay parent at some point in their lives (Gates, 2013).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The legal, cultural, and technological landscapes facing gay parents and their children have changed dramatically in recent years. Increasingly tolerant attitudes toward LGBTQ persons have been accompanied by a growing tendency for courts to allocate custody of children to mothers living in lesbian relationships. All 50 states now allow LGBTQ individuals to adopt a child, although states vary in their policies regarding second-parent adoption (where one partner adopts a child and the partner applies to be a second or co-parent) and joint adoption (where the partners adopt a child together) (Family Equality Council, 2014). Although lesbian couples may have a child by donor insemination and gay men may rely on a surrogate to carry a biological child, same-sex couples are four times as likely as different-sex married or cohabiting couples to have an adopted child or stepchild (22 percent versus 5 percent). Just 73 percent of same-sex couples have biological children only (compared to roughly 90 percent of different-sex married or cohabiting couples). Roughly similar shares of same-sex and different-sex couples have both biological and adopted children or stepchildren (4 to 6 percent) (Gates, 2013).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Popular media images in recent years, such as the film <i class="italic">The Kids Are All Right</i> and TV show <i class="italic">Modern Family</i>, depict same-sex parents as providing the same love and guidance as heterosexual parents. But what do sociological studies show? Does parental sexual orientation shape how children turn out? This question continues to generate heated political debates today, although a strong consensus has emerged among scholars that the ability to parent effectively is not related to sexual orientation. Although one controversial study argued that children of parents who had ever had a same-sex relationship would go on to face greater adversity, this study has since been discredited for its serious methodological limitations (Regnerus, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The most persuasive and comprehensive studies to date, including the American Psychological Association’s (2005) review of 60 studies and the American Academy of Pediatrics’ (2013) seminal report, have concluded that “not a single study has found children of lesbian or gay parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents” (Perrin, Cohen, and Caren, 2013). The 60 studies considered a range of outcomes, including school performance, social adjustment, and emotional well-being, concluding that children’s well-being is much more closely tied to their parents’ <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_608" title="608"></span>“sense of competence and security”—and the “social and economic support” parents provided their children—than sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For example, Rosenfeld (2010) finds that children of gay parents are just as likely as the children of straight parents to progress successfully throughout their school grades without being left back. Part of the reason children fare equally well regardless of parental sexual orientation is that sexual orientation has no bearing on one’s capacity to be a loving parent. Moreover, children of same-sex couples usually share a common peer and school environment with children of heterosexual couples. As such, their experiences at school and with peers are very similar regardless of their parents’ romantic preferences (Rosenfeld, 2010). Most studies also show no differences in the psychological adjustment of children raised by same-sex or opposite-sex parents; for example, several studies of teenagers show no differences in their depressive symptoms, anxiety, self-esteem, or risk of ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) (Baiocco et al., 2018; Adams and Light, 2015; Gattrell and Bos, 2010; Lamb, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although children of either gay or straight parents are not significantly advantaged or disadvantaged, some studies point out a small number of differences. For example, sociologists Judith Stacey and Timothy Biblarz (2001) reviewed 21 studies dating back to the 1980s and found that children in gay households are more likely to buck stereotypical male-female behavior. For example, boys raised by lesbians appear to be less aggressive and more nurturing than boys raised in heterosexual families. Daughters of lesbians are more likely to aspire to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, and astronauts. The balance of evidence shows that children of gay parents are just as happy, healthy, and academically successful as their peers raised by heterosexual parents, and they may have more flexible views of gender and gender-typed behaviors.</p>
