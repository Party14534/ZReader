<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we have already learned, a person’s social-class position has a significant impact on their lifestyle. Most sociologists identify social classes in terms of wealth, income, and occupation, noting how social class influences consumption, education, health, and access to political power. The purpose of the following discussion is to describe broad class differences in the United States. Bear in mind that there are no sharply defined boundaries between the classes, and no real agreement among sociologists about where the boundaries should fall.</p>

<section id="the-upper-class">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">The Upper Class</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-upper-class" href="part0056_split_004.html#upper-class">upper class</a> consists of the very wealthiest Americans—those households earning more than $207,400, approximately 20 percent of all American households (Horowitz et al., 2020a). Most Americans in the upper class are wealthy but not superrich. They are likely to own a large suburban home and perhaps a vacation home as well, drive expensive automobiles, vacation abroad, and educate their children in private schools and colleges. At the lower levels of this group, a large part of income may come from salaried earnings. This group includes many professionals, from some doctors and lawyers to university administrators and possibly even a few highly compensated professors.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">At the very top of the upper class are the superrich—people who have accumulated vast fortunes that permit them to enjoy a lifestyle unimaginable to most Americans. If one uses a cutoff of the richest 0.1 percent in terms of income, these are people whose income tops $7.3 million, roughly 140,000 Americans (Picchi, 2019). Their wealth stems in large part from their substantial investments, from stocks and bonds to real estate, and from the interest income derived from those investments. They include people who have acquired their wealth in a variety of ways: celebrities, professional athletes, the heads of major corporations, people who have made large amounts of money through investments or real estate, and those fortunate enough to have inherited great wealth from their parents.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A recent book by sociologist Rachel Sherman showed that the superrich and those below them in the top 1 percent are conscious of their unique and privileged social class position; some give generously to such worthy causes as the arts, hospitals, and charities (Sherman, 2017). Their homes are often lavish and sometimes filled with collections of fine art. Yet, whereas previous generations of wealthy people in America were proud of their class identity as indicated by such things as being listed in the social register, today’s wealthy tend to downplay their money, experiencing the “anxieties of affluence” (Sherman, 2017).</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Frequently they have attended the same exclusive private secondary schools (to which they also send their children). They sit on the same corporate boards of directors and belong to the same private clubs. Sherman found that they contribute large sums of money to their favorite politicians and are likely to be on a first-name basis with members of Congress and perhaps even with the president. Yet, their reasons for donating to charities and even political campaigns might be about more than having a significant influence on American politics (Domhoff, 2013). Many of the wealthiest are sensitive to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_257" title="257"></span>moral judgments that are made about their lifestyles. They thus expend a great deal of energy trying to confirm their moral worth in others’ eyes. At times, this entails downplaying their wealth and minimizing their privilege, as well as making grand gestures to “give back” to society (Sherman, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The turn of the twenty-first century saw extraordinary opportunities for the accumulation of such wealth. Globalization is one reason. Entrepreneurs who are able to invest globally often prosper, by selling products to foreign consumers and making profits cheaply by using low-wage labor in developing countries. The information revolution is another reason for the accumulation of wealth. Young entrepreneurs with start-up, high-tech companies, such as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Yahoo! cofounder Jerry Yang, made legendary fortunes. In 2019, Zuckerberg was the sixth wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $62.3 billion (Kroll and Dolan, 2019a).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As a consequence of globalization and the information revolution, the number of superrich Americans has exploded in recent years. At the end of World War II, only 13,000 people were worth $1 million or more in the United States. Today, the 400 richest Americans are worth $2.96 trillion; the cutoff to join this exclusive “club” is a net worth of $1.7 billion (Kroll and Dolan, 2019a). Unlike “old money” families such as the Rockefellers or the Vanderbilts, who accumulated their wealth in earlier generations and thus are viewed as a sort of American aristocracy, much of this “new wealth” is held primarily by entrepreneurs—including such recent arrivals as WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum ($9.7 billion) and cofounder and CEO of SnapChat, Evan Spiegel ($2.0 billion).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While Americans have long glamorized and aspired to be part of this extraordinarily wealthy elite, perceptions of the superrich have changed in recent years. The recession that began with the financial collapse of 2007–2008, combined with growing income inequality, triggered movements such as Occupy Wall Street, during which protesters sought to bring attention to what they saw as greed, corruption, and undeserved political power among the very wealthy. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that nearly two-thirds believe that the rich-poor gap has increased over the past 10 years, and 6 out of 10 believe that the economic system is unfair, favoring the wealthy rather than everyone else. Slightly more than half (54 percent) would tax the rich and corporations to provide programs for the poor, although strong differences by political party exist on this issue. Such a redistribution of wealth is favored by 75 percent of Democrats and 51 percent of independents, but only 29 percent of Republicans (Pew Research Center, 2014b).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">The Middle Class</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-middle-class" href="part0056_split_004.html#middle-class">Middle class</a> is a catchall term for a diverse group of occupations, lifestyles, and people who earn stable and sometimes substantial incomes at primarily white-collar and highly skilled blue-collar jobs. It is generally considered to include households with income between $42,000 and $126,000 (dependent on the size of the household), which includes roughly 50 percent of all households (Snider, 2019; LaMagna, 2018). While the middle class was once largely White, today it is increasingly diverse—both racially and culturally—and includes African Americans, Asian Americans, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_258" title="258"></span>Latinos. The middle class grew throughout much of the first three-quarters of the twentieth century but has been shrinking for most of the past four decades.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For many years, when Americans were asked to identify their social class, the majority claimed to be middle class (Boushey and Hersh, 2012). The reason lay partly in the pervasive cultural belief that the United States is relatively free of class distinctions; few people want to be identified as being too rich or too poor. Most Americans seem to think that others are not very different from their immediate family, friends, or coworkers. Since people seldom interact with those outside their social class, they tend to see themselves as being like “most other people,” whom they then regard as being “middle class” (Kelley and Evans, 1995).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The perception that “we are all middle class” has changed in recent years, however. In public opinion polls taken in 2015, 47 percent of Americans identified as middle class, down from 53 percent in 2008 (Pew Research Center, 2015b). The 2008 recession was partly to blame, as well as the uneven economic recovery that followed. The stock market may have risen to record levels by 2014, but this increase did not benefit the majority of Americans. Eighty-five percent of self-described middle-class respondents to a 2012 survey said it had become more difficult for them to maintain their wealth in the ten years between 2001 and 2010, and reported declines in both income and net worth (Pew Research Center, 2012b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The American middle class can be further subdivided into two groups: the upper middle class and the lower middle class.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">The Upper Middle Class</b> The upper middle class consists of highly educated professionals (for example, doctors, lawyers, engineers, and professors), mid-level corporate managers, people who own or manage small businesses and retail shops, and some large farm owners. Household incomes range quite widely, from about $126,000 to perhaps $188,000 (Snider, 2019). The lower half of the income category would include college professors, for example, while the higher end would include corporate managers and small business owners. The upper middle class includes approximately 19 percent of all American households (Kochhar, 2018). Its members are likely to be college educated (as are their children), with advanced degrees. They own comfortable homes, drive expensive late-model cars, have some savings and investments, and are often active in local politics and civic organizations. However, they tend not to enjoy the same high-end luxuries, social connections, or extravagances as do members of the upper class. Historically, their jobs have been secure and provided retirement, pension, and health benefits, yet many upper-middle-class persons—especially those working in finance and media—have been susceptible to layoffs and have seen their pension and home-value wealth shrink (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2010).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">The Lower Middle Class</b> The lower middle class consists of trained office workers (for example, secretaries and bookkeepers), elementary and high school teachers, nurses, salespeople, police officers, firefighters, and others who provide skilled services. This group, which includes about 40 percent of American households, is the most varied of the social-class strata and may include college-educated persons with relatively modest earnings, such as public elementary school teachers, and quite highly paid persons with high school diplomas only, such as skilled craftspeople (e.g., plumbers) and civil servants with many years of seniority. Household incomes in this group range from <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_259" title="259"></span>about $31,000 to $42,000 (Snider, 2019). The number of Americans who identify as “lower class” or “lower middle class” has increased in recent years. In 2008, roughly a quarter of all adults put themselves in this category; in 2012, fully a third so identified. The numbers have increased even more among millennials (from 25 percent to 39 percent) as young people become increasingly worried about their career prospects (Morin and Motel, 2012). As of 2016, 11 percent of individuals self-identify as lower class, and another 36 percent self-identify as lower middle class (Pew Research Center, 2016c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Members of the lower middle class may own a modest house, although many live in rental units. Their automobiles may be late models, but not the more expensive ones. Almost all have a high school education, and some have college degrees. They want their children to attend college, although this goal usually requires work-study programs and student loans. They are rarely politically active beyond exercising their right to vote. Like upper-middle-class persons, lower-middle-class workers have seen their job security and financial security decline as a result of the 2008 recession, and these threats have disproportionately struck African Americans and persons who work in the public sector (Pitts, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While firefighters, police officers, and schoolteachers have historically enjoyed job security, this is no longer the case. Between 2009 and 2011, state and local governments throughout the United States laid off 429,000 workers (Pitts, 2011). For example, in June 2012, the New Orleans school system announced the layoffs of 200 teachers (Vanacore, 2012), while the impoverished city of Camden, New Jersey, witnessed the layoffs of nearly 250 firefighters, police officers, and city employees in 2011; public workers in dozens of other American cities have seen their pensions threatened (Kaplan and Eligon, 2012). Most recently, however, the impact of COVID-19 has raised the unemployment rate to 14.7 percent as of April 2020, while unemployment claims passed 40 million by the end of May 2020 (<i class="italic">New York Times</i>, 2020; Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020c).</p>

<section id="the-working-class">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">The Working Class</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-working-class" href="part0056_split_004.html#working-class">working class</a> includes primarily blue-collar workers such as mechanics and pink-collar laborers such as clerical aides. Household incomes range from about $20,000 to $40,000 (Elwell, 2014a), and at least two household members must work to make ends meet. Family income is just enough to pay the rent or the mortgage, put food on the table, and perhaps save for a summer vacation. The working class includes factory workers, mechanics, office workers, salesclerks, restaurant and hotel workers, and others who earn a modest weekly paycheck at a job that involves little control over the size of their income or working conditions. According to a Gallup poll from 2017, about 30 percent of Americans self-identify as working class (Bird and Newport, 2017). As you will see later in this chapter, many manufacturing jobs in the United States are threatened by economic globalization, and so members of the working class today are likely to feel insecure about their own and their family’s future.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The working class is racially and ethnically diverse. While older members of the working class may own a home bought several years ago, younger members are likely to rent. The home or apartment is likely to be in a lower-income suburb or a city neighborhood. The household car, a lower-priced <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_260" title="260"></span>model, is unlikely to be new. Most members of the working class are not likely to be politically active even in their own community, although they may vote in some elections.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Children of working-class families often bypass college and instead seek full-time work immediately after graduating from high school. However, high school graduates’ employment and earnings prospects are bleak. While in 2019, the unemployment rate for people 25 and older with only a high school diploma was 3.7 percent, median weekly earnings were only $712; for high school dropouts, the situation was even worse, with 5.3 percent unemployed and median weekly earnings of $520 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019n; Torpey, 2018). Rutgers University researchers studied high school graduates from the classes of 2009 to 2011 who did not go on to college; as of 2011, only 16 percent were working full time, 37 percent were unemployed and looking for work, 17 percent were unemployed and had given up on finding work, and 13 percent were hoping to up their current work hours from part time to full time (Van Horn et al., 2012). Of those who had found jobs, the median hourly wage was $7.50, just $0.25 above the federal minimum wage. These bleak employment prospects bode poorly for their futures; two-thirds of the high school graduates viewed important life transitions such as starting a family or owning a home as many years off in the future.</p>

<section id="the-lower-class">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_4">The Lower Class</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-lower-class" href="part0056_split_004.html#lower-class">lower class</a>, which overlaps with the working class to account for about 29 percent of American households, includes some full-time, low-wage workers and those who work part-time or not at all; their annual household income is typically lower than $31,000 (Kochhar, 2018; Snider, 2019). Most lower-class individuals live in cities, although some live in rural areas and earn a little money as farmers or part-time workers. Some manage to find employment in semiskilled or unskilled manufacturing or service jobs, ranging from making clothing in sweatshops to cleaning houses. Their jobs, when they can find them, are dead-end jobs, since years of work are unlikely to lead to promotion or substantially higher income. Their work is probably part-time and highly unstable, without benefits such as medical insurance, disability, or Social Security. Even if they are fortunate enough to find a full-time job, there are no guarantees that it will be around next month or even next week.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many people in the lower class live in poverty. Very few own their own homes. Most of the lower class rent, and some are homeless. If they own a car at all, it is likely to be a used car. A higher percentage of the lower class is non-White than is true of other social classes (Lin and Harris, 2010). Members of the lower class do not participate in politics, and they seldom vote.</p>
