<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">What Comes after Modern Industrial Society?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Where is social change leading us today? If social theorists do not agree on the nature of globalization, they also differ on where these changes are leading us. Here, we examine two competing perspectives: the notion that we are a postindustrial society and the idea that we have reached a postmodern period.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some observers have suggested that what is occurring today is a transition to a new society, one that is no longer primarily based on industrialism. We are entering, they claim, a phase of development beyond the industrial era altogether. A variety of terms have been coined to describe this new social order, such as <i class="italic">information society</i>, <i class="italic">service society</i>, and <i class="italic">knowledge society</i>. The term that has come into most common use, however—first employed by Daniel Bell (1976) in the United States and Alain Touraine (1974) in France—is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-postindustrial-society" href="part0131_split_003.html#postindustrial-society">postindustrial society</a>, the <i class="italic">post</i> (meaning “after”) referring to the sense that we are moving beyond the old forms of industrial development.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The diversity of terms reflects the countless ideas put forward to interpret current social changes. But one consistent theme is the significance of information or knowledge in the society of the future. Our ways of life throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, based largely on machine power (the manufacture of material goods in factories), is being displaced by one in which information underlies the production system.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In his now-classic <i class="italic">The Coming of Post-Industrial Society</i>, Bell (1976) argues that the postindustrial order is distinguished by a growth of service occupations at the expense of jobs that produce material goods. The blue-collar worker is no longer the most essential type of employee. White-collar (clerical and professional) workers outnumber blue-collar (factory) workers, with professional and technical occupations growing fastest of all. People working in higher-level white-collar occupations specialize in the production of information and knowledge. The production and control of what Bell calls “codified knowledge”—systematic, coordinated information—is society’s main productive resource. Those who create and distribute this knowledge—scientists, computer specialists, economists, engineers, and professionals of all kinds—increasingly become the leading social groups, replacing industrialists and entrepreneurs. On the level of culture, there is a shift away from the work ethic characteristic of industrialism; <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_849" title="849"></span>people are freer to innovate and enjoy themselves in both their work and their domestic lives.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Other scholars have gone as far as saying that the developments now occurring are even more profound than signaling the end of the era of industrialism. Postmodern scholars claim that we are witnessing a movement beyond modernity—the attitudes and ways of life associated with modern societies, such as our belief in progress, the benefits of science, and our capability to control the modern world. Advocates of postmodernity claim that modern societies drew inspiration from the idea that history has a shape—it “goes somewhere” and leads to progress—and that now this notion has collapsed. There are no longer any overall conceptions of history that make sense (Lyotard, 1985). Not only is there no general notion of progress that can be defended, but there is no such thing as history. The TRIPS <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-postmodern-society" href="part0131_split_003.html#postmodern-society">postmodern society</a> is thus highly pluralistic and diverse. In countless films, videos, and TV programs, images circulate worldwide. We encounter many ideas and values, but these have little connection with the history of the areas we live in, or indeed with our own personal histories. Everything seems constantly in flux. According to one group of authors,</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Our world is being remade. Mass production, the mass consumer, the big city, big-brother state, the sprawling housing estate, and the nation-state are in decline: flexibility, diversity, differentiation, and mobility, communication, decentralization and internationalization are in the ascendant. In the process our own identities, our sense of self, our own subjectivities are being transformed. We are in transition to a new era. (Hall et al., 1988)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While both the postindustrial and postmodern theorists provide important insights, each has shortcomings as well. Critics of the postindustrial argument claim that the trend toward service occupations began with the Industrial Revolution and that service workers have replaced not industrial workers so much as agricultural workers. Moreover, the notion that creative and challenging white-collar work is replacing highly routinized factory work is incorrect; much service-sector employment today is just as routinized and unsatisfying as factory work was in the past (and pays less). The postindustrial society thesis is also criticized for exaggerating the importance of economic factors in producing social change. Finally, critics point out that any attempt to divide history into before and after stages is bound to be proven wrong over time as new (and unanticipated) technological breakthroughs, and their associated social changes, occur.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Postmodern theorists agree with this final criticism, seeing societies as moving into a stage that is so radically different that any attempt to understand general processes <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_851" title="851"></span>in the social world is doomed, as is the notion that we can change the world for the better. Writers such as Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens have strongly criticized this position, arguing instead that, as much as ever, general theories of the social world allow us to intervene to shape it in a positive way. Such theories have considered how contemporary societies are becoming globalized, while everyday life is breaking free from tradition and custom. But these changes should not spell the end of social and political reform. Values, such as a belief in the importance of social community, equality, and caring for the weak and vulnerable, are still very much alive worldwide.</p>
