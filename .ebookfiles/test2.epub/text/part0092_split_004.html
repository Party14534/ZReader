<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">The Informal Economy</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many types of work do not conform to orthodox categories of paid employment; they cannot be classified as either Fordist or post-Fordist. Much of the work done in all societies, for example, is performed outside formal business firms, and indeed, outside the formal economy itself. The term <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-informal-economy" href="part0092_split_005.html#informal-economy">informal economy</a> refers to transactions outside the sphere of regular employment, sometimes involving the exchange of cash for goods and services provided, for which no official records are kept, and which therefore escape government notice. Your child’s babysitter might be paid in cash, “off the books,” without any receipt being given or details of the job recorded; the same may be true of the person who cleans your house or does your gardening, if you have such services.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In poor countries, a significant part of the national economy consists of such informal work. One study estimates that the informal economy may account for 70 percent of employment in sub-Saharan Africa and contribute about 55 percent of the region’s GNI (UN Economic Commission for Africa, 2015). The informal economy in the developing world has a high presence of women, involving as many as 60 percent of working women (Mbaye and Benjamin, 2014). The high prevalence of informal economy work in developing countries has both positive and negative effects. Among the former, such work provides employment and earnings, and, in many cases, can make the difference between absolute poverty and subsistence-level survival. While much informal-sector work involves self-employment, in some cases, it also enables people to form small businesses. On the negative side, because such work is by definition “off the books,” the informal sector is unregulated, unreported, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_526" title="526"></span>unprotected by the state, and prone to abuse. Since informal-sector work is officially unknown to the state, it does not contribute to taxes or pension funds, which deprives the state of revenues (although where governments are corrupt, this may actually be a benefit) (Benjamin, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the United States, the informal economy was estimated to add only 9 percent to the GNI in the year 2000—which, given the large size of the American economy, amounted to nearly $1 trillion in goods and services exchanged that never appeared in any official government accounts (Schneider and Enste, 2002; Barnes, 2009). Another study doubles that amount, concluding that income-tax evasion annually involves some $2 trillion in unreported income (Cebula and Feige, 2011). This includes illegal goods and services, from drugs to prostitution, which can now be purchased on the so-called “dark web” with a high degree of anonymity. “Darknet markets,” such as the Dream Market—which shut down in 2019 following government crackdowns on web drug trafficking and cyber ransom demands (Cimpanu, 2019)—operate through such legal websites as the Tor Network, an open-source website that assures anonymity by relaying messages to a secret distributed network of servers around the world.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One study estimated that as of April 2015, there were 15 darknet marketplaces listing over 43,000 illicit drugs (Digital Citizens Alliance [DCA], 2015). Illegal drugs <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_527" title="527"></span>constitute a major part of the informal economy in some countries: In Afghanistan, opiate trade brought in an estimated $1–2 billion in 2019 representing 6–11 percent of the country’s GNI (UN Office on Drugs and Crime, 2019). There is widespread disagreement over the size of the global drug trade—not surprising, perhaps, given its illicit and secretive nature. Moreover, drug enforcement agencies have an interest in showing that there is a significant need for their services, which may result in inflated estimates of the problem (Blickman, 2003; Thoumi, 2003; Reuter and Greenfield, 2001).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The informal economy includes not only “hidden” cash transactions but also many forms of self-provisioning, which people carry on inside and outside the home. Do-it-yourself activities and household appliances and tools, for instance, provide goods and services that would otherwise have to be purchased. And it also often includes the labor of possibly millions of undocumented immigrant workers who toil in factories and restaurants or clean houses and do yard work. Such work often goes unreported, which means the wages are often below the legal minimum, and workers have no recourse if they are underpaid (or indeed, not paid at all).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Globally, it is estimated that there are nearly 70 million domestic workers, the vast majority of whom are women. Nearly one out of six are migrants in the countries where they work, which means they are especially vulnerable to all forms of economic, physical and sexual abuse (ILO, 2016). In the United States, some 2 million domestic workers play a critical economic role, doing work such as housecleaning, caring for children, and serving as caregivers for the infirm and elderly. Home health care is one of the fastest-growing jobs in the U.S. economy, as aging baby boomers, many with declining health, choose to stay at home rather than move into nursing homes (there are currently 55 million Americans over 70, and 20 million over 80). An estimated 2 million home health care workers, mainly women, earn poverty-level wages providing emotionally stressful and physically demanding work (the 2017 median income for home health care workers was only $16,200). Turnover in this field is understandably high, and an additional million new jobs will be needed by 2026 to serve the growing number of elderly who need care (PHI, 2019; Newman, 2019; US Census, 2018e).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most domestic workers are women; most are non-White; and many are immigrants (including many who are undocumented). Because domestic workers are typically socially isolated as well as “off the books,” their lack of access to legal protection invites exploitation and abuse. There is a large demand for domestic workers, both because in two-person households both members are likely to be working, and because there is an abundant supply of people who are desperate for work (Wallis, 2019; Burnham, Theodore, and Ehrenreich, 2012).</p>
