<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Advocates of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-postmodernism" href="part0012_split_007.html#postmodernism">postmodernism</a> claim that the classic social thinkers’ idea that history has a shape—it “goes somewhere” and leads to progress—has collapsed. No longer do any “grand narratives,” or metanarratives—overall conceptions of history or society—make any sense (Lyotard, 1985). In fact, there is no such thing as history. The postmodern world is not destined, as Marx hoped, to be a <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_24" title="24"></span>socialist one. Instead, it is dominated by the new media, which “take us out” of our past. Postmodern society is highly pluralistic and diverse. As countless films, videos, TV programs, and websites circulate images around the world, the many ideas and values we encounter have little connection with our local or personal histories. Everything seems constantly in flux: “[F]lexibility, diversity, differentiation, and mobility, communication, decentralization and internationalization are in the ascendant. In the process our own identities, our sense of self, our own subjectivities are being transformed” (Hall, Held, and McGrew, 1988).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One important theorist of postmodernity, Jean Baudrillard (1929–2007), believed that electronic media created a chaotic, empty world. Despite being influenced by Marxism in his early years, Baudrillard argued that the spread of electronic communication and the mass media reversed the Marxist theorem that economic forces shape society. Instead, he asserted, social life is influenced above all by signs and images. In a media-dominated age, Baudrillard said, meaning is created by the flow of images, as in TV programs. Much of our world is now a make-believe universe in which we respond to media images rather than to real persons or places. Is “reality” television a portrayal of social “reality,” or does it feature televised people who are perceived to be “real”? Do hunters in Louisiana really look and act like the Robertson family on <i class="italic">Duck Dynasty</i>, and do the tough guys in <i class="italic">Amish Mafia</i> resemble the peaceful Amish who live and work in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania? Baudrillard would say no and would describe such images as “the dissolution of life into TV.”</p>
