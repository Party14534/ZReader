<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Blacks in the United States</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">By 1780, there were nearly 4 million slaves in the American South. Slaves had no legal rights whatsoever. But they did not passively accept the conditions their masters imposed on them. The struggles of slaves sometimes took the form of direct opposition or disobedience to orders, and occasionally rebellion, though collective slave revolts were more common in the Caribbean than in the United States. On a more subtle level, their response involved a cultural creativity—a mixing of aspects of African cultures, Christian ideals, and cultural threads from their new environments. Some of the art forms they developed—for example, jazz—were genuinely new.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Hostility toward Blacks on the part of Whites was in some respects stronger in states where slavery had never existed than in the South itself. As the French political observer Alexis de Tocqueville noted in 1835, “The prejudice of race appears to be stronger in the states that have abolished slavery than in those where it still exists; and nowhere is it so intolerant as in those states where servitude has never been known.” Moral rejection of slavery was confined to a few more educated groups. The main factors underlying the Civil War were political and economic; most Northern leaders were more interested in sustaining the Union than in abolishing slavery, although the abolition of slavery was an eventual outcome of the conflict. The formal abolition of slavery barely changed the real conditions of life for African Americans in the South. The “Black codes”—laws limiting the rights of Blacks—restricted the behavior of the former slaves and punished their transgressions in much the same way they had suffered under slavery. Acts legalizing segregation of Blacks from Whites in public places were passed. One kind of slavery was thus replaced by another: that of social, political, and economic discrimination.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Internal Migration from South to North</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Industrial development in the North combined with the mechanization of agriculture in the South produced a progressive movement of African Americans northward. In 1900, more than 90 percent of African Americans lived in the South, mostly in rural areas. Today, three-quarters of the Black population live in Northern urban areas. African Americans used to be farm laborers and domestic servants, but in the course of little more than two generations, they have become mainly urban, industrial, and service-economy workers. But African Americans have not assimilated into the wider society in the way White immigrants did. They still face conditions of neighborhood segregation and poverty that other immigrants faced only upon arrival. Together with <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_393" title="393"></span>those of Anglo-Saxon origin, African Americans have lived in the United States far longer than most other immigrant groups. What was a transitional experience for most of the later White immigrants has become a seemingly permanent experience for Blacks.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">The Civil Rights Movement</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In contrast to other racial and ethnic minorities, Blacks and Native Americans have largely been denied opportunities for self-advancement. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the National Urban League were founded in 1909 and 1910, respectively, to promote Black civil rights. However, they did not have a significant effect until after World War II, when the NAACP instituted a campaign against segregated public education. This struggle came to a head when the organization sued five school boards, challenging the concept of separate but equal schooling. In 1954, in <i class="italic">Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas</i>, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This decision underpinned struggles for civil rights from the 1950s to the 1970s. The strength of the resistance from many Whites persuaded Black leaders that mass militancy was necessary. In 1955, a Black woman, Rosa Parks, was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama, for declining to give up her seat on a bus to a White man. As a result, nearly the entire African American population of the city, led by a Baptist minister, Martin Luther King Jr., boycotted the transportation system for 381 days. Eventually, the city was forced to abolish segregation on public transportation.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Further boycotts and sit-ins followed, with the objective of desegregating other public facilities. The marches and demonstrations began to achieve a mass following from Blacks and from White sympathizers. In 1963, a quarter of a million civil rights supporters staged a march on Washington and cheered as King announced, “We will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like the waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.” In 1964, the Civil Rights Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, banning discrimination in public facilities, education, employment, and any agency receiving government funds. Subsequent bills outlawed discrimination in housing and ensured that African Americans became fully registered voters.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although civil rights marchers were beaten up and some lost their lives, and in spite of some barriers to full realization of the Civil Rights Act’s provisions, the law was fundamentally important. Its principles applied <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_394" title="394"></span>not just to African Americans but also to anyone subject to discrimination, including other ethnic groups and women. It spurred a range of movements asserting the rights of oppressed groups.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">How successful has the civil rights movement been? On one hand, a substantial Black middle class has emerged. Many African Americans—such as the writer Toni Morrison, the literary scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr., former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, media moguls Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z, and President Barack Obama—have achieved positions of power and influence. On the other hand, a significant African American underclass remains trapped in the ghettos. Scholars have debated whether this underclass has resulted primarily from economic disadvantage or from dependency on the welfare system. Later in this chapter, we will examine the forms of inequality still experienced by African Americans and other minority groups.</p>
