<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This leads to another question: Does the future of work mean the end of the full-time, lifelong career with one or at best a few employers?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Since the mid-1980s, in all the industrialized countries except the United States, the average length of the working week has become shorter. Workers still undertake long stretches of overtime, but some governments are beginning to introduce new limits on permissible working hours. In France, for example, annual overtime is restricted to a maximum of 130 hours a year. In most countries, there is a general tendency toward shortening the average working career. More people would probably quit the labor force at age 60 or earlier if they could afford to do so.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another important employment trend of the past decade has been the replacement of full-time workers by part-time workers and contingency workers, or workers who <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_556" title="556"></span>are hired on a contract or “freelance” basis often for a short-term task. Most temporary or contingent workers are hired for the least-skilled, lowest-paying jobs. But, increasingly, contingent work is making its way into professional occupations as well, including higher education. Contingent faculty now comprise three-fourths of higher education faculty (House Committee on Education and the Workforce, 2014). As a general rule, part-time and contract jobs do not include the benefits associated with full-time work, such as medical insurance, paid vacation time, or retirement benefits. Because employers can save on the costs of wages and benefits, the use of part-time and contingent workers has become increasingly common. A 2015 survey found that the proportion of the U.S. workforce engaged in alternative work arrangements, defined as temp workers, contract workers, on-call workers, and freelancers, increased over 50 percent between 2005 and 2015, from 10 percent in 2005 to nearly 16 percent in 2015 (Katz and Kreuger, 2016). According to the General Accountability Office (2015), if you expand alternative work to include part-time employees, the proportion rises to more than 40 percent.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The temporary employment agency Manpower Group, Inc., founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1948, has become a global leader in the provision of temporary workers. This company placed 3.4 million temps in 80 countries and territories in 2014, claiming 400,000 clients worldwide (Manpower Group, 2014). But Manpower has been surpassed in size by Kelly Services, founded in Detroit in 1946. Kelly Services was previously known as “Kelly Girls,” but it was renamed in 1966 “to reflect the growing services of the company” (including the fact that it placed men as well <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_557" title="557"></span>as women). Kelly Services found jobs for more than 540,000 workers in 2013; it was ranked 490th among the Fortune 500 in 2017. Temp agencies like Manpower Group and Kelly Services provide labor on a flexible basis around the world, in blue-collar manufacturing as well as services (Grabell, 2013). Clearly, temporary labor has become a critical component of the worldwide organization of work and occupations.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">How will work change in the future? It appears very likely that people will take a more active look at their lives than in the past, moving in and out of paid work at different points. These are positive options, however, only when they are deliberately chosen. The reality for most is that regular paid work remains the key to day-to-day survival and that part-time work is experienced as a hardship rather than an opportunity.</p>
