<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Investigating and accounting for gender inequality has become a central concern of sociologists. Explanations vary widely, from functionalist approaches, which view such differences as key to societal stability, to radical feminist approaches, which view gender inequalities as a product of male oppression. These perspectives have been advanced to explain men’s enduring dominance over women—in the realm of economics, politics, the family, and elsewhere. In this section, we review the main theoretical approaches to explaining gender inequality in society.</p>
