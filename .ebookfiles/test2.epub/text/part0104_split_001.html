<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The first perspective, schooling as a process of assimilation, focuses on what might be called the “official” curriculum and looks at questions such as how learning a common language and the facts of a common history and geography create a sense of “affinity” among members of society, which is something less than full consensus (Shils, 1972). The official curriculum promotes feelings of nationalism and is instrumental in the development of national societies, constituted of citizens from different regions who would then know the same history and speak a common language (Ramirez and Boli, 1987; Shils, 1972). In this approach, the content of education is particularly important in creating a common culture. For example, public schools historically have taught the children of immigrants about “American” foods, holidays, legends, and heroes to help them (and their immigrant parents) become fully steeped in our nation’s culture. But even children whose parents are part of the country’s dominant culture depend on the official curriculum to develop an image of themselves as Americans with a common history.</p>
