<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The sociological study of culture and society began with Émile Durkheim in the nineteenth century. The work of early sociologists strongly reflected the values of highly educated Europeans who often assumed that “primitive” cultures were inferior and lagged behind modern European “civilization.” However, two destructive world wars, fought largely among European countries that claimed to be the most “civilized” cultures on earth, helped discredit that belief. Sociologists now recognize that there are many different cultures and societies, each with distinctive characteristics. The task of social science is to understand this diversity, which is best done by avoiding value judgments.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-culture" href="part0023_split_004.html#culture">Culture</a> consists of the values the members of a group hold, the norms they follow, the material goods they create, and the languages and symbols they use to construct their understanding of the world, including both speech and writing. Some elements of culture, especially people’s beliefs and expectations about one another and about the world they inhabit, are components of all social relations. Culture therefore refers to the ways of life of individual members or groups within a society—their manner of dress, their marriage customs and family life, their patterns of work, their religious ceremonies, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_61" title="61"></span>their leisure pursuits. The concept also covers the goods they create—bows and arrows, plows, factories and machines, computers, books, and dwellings. We should think of culture as a “design for living” or a “tool kit” of practices, knowledge, and symbols acquired through learning, rather than by instinct, that enable people to live in society (Kluckhohn, 1949; Swidler, 1986).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-society" href="part0023_split_004.html#society">society</a> is a system of interrelationships that connects individuals. The word <i class="italic">society</i>—like the word <i class="italic">social</i>—derives from a Latin term for the ties that bind people together, ties that make sustained human interaction possible. Such bonds can be informal—such as friendship or family—or formal, such as religious organizations, businesses, or entire nations. One characteristic of societies, at least as sociologists see them, is that they are relatively enduring over time. For this to occur, societies require some degree of common culture—a set of shared values to guide behavior. No society could exist without culture, and conversely, no culture could exist without a society.</p>
