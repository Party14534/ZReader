<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Democracy in the United States</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The United States is a representative democracy in which political participation is achieved through elected representatives. Political parties have come to play a key role in elections, while interest groups have significant (and, some would argue, growing) influence behind the scenes and on electoral politics. The most important recent change in the U.S. political system is the rise of populist movements that regard government as controlled by insiders—what we have termed the “deep state”—and therefore unresponsive to popular interests.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Challenges have come from conservatives (the “Tea Party” movement), leftist progressives (the 2016 and 2020 Bernie Sanders presidential campaigns), and more extremist right-wing organizations (the so-called alt-right), the latter seen as contributing to the rise of populist authoritarianism. Donald Trump’s Electoral College victory, organized under the slogan “America First,” successfully coalesced the votes of White working-class Americans who blamed globalization and immigrants for job loss; Tea Party members and other conservatives who favored a vastly reduced role of government; and members of the alt-right, who turned out in large numbers for Trump campaign rallies.</p>
<section id="elections">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Elections</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A political party is an organization of individuals with broadly similar political aims, oriented toward achieving legitimate control of government through an electoral process. Two parties dominate political systems where elections are based on the principle of winner take all, as in the United States. The candidate who gains the most votes wins the election, no matter what proportion of the overall vote they gain. Exceptions to this general rule in the United States involve presidential elections, which are decided by the Electoral College. Under this system, each state has a number of electors equal to its total congressional representation: the number of seats it holds in the House of Representatives (which is proportional to its population), plus its two senators. Whichever candidate gets the largest number of votes in a state gets all the state’s electoral votes.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As a result, a tiny margin of victory in a populous state such as California, New York, or Florida can swing a close election. At three times in American history, one candidate won the majority of votes from citizens (the popular vote) but still lost the Electoral College vote. This occurred in 2000, when Al Gore outpolled George W. Bush by about 500,000 votes but still lost the electoral vote by 271 to 267, and again in 2016, when Hillary Clinton outpolled Donald Trump by 2.9 million votes but lost the electoral vote by 306 to 232. Although Clinton won large margins of victory in <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_469" title="469"></span>populous states such as California and New York, she failed to carry crucial states such as Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—so-called “swing” states that the Clinton campaign was initially favored to win. In three of those states, accounting for 46 electoral votes (Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin), Clinton lost by a combined total of 80,000 votes; a shift of 1 percent of the vote in each of those states would have resulted in her winning the Electoral College (Bump, 2016b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Where elections are based on different principles, such as proportional representation (in which seats in a representative assembly are allocated according to the proportions of the vote attained), five or six or more parties may be represented in the assembly. When no single party has a majority, some of the parties have to form a coalition, an alliance with one another, to form a government.</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As a consequence of the winner-take-all electoral system, the United States effectively has only two significant political parties, Republicans and Democrats, since it is virtually impossible for minor parties to garner sufficient electoral votes to win presidential elections. Two-party systems often lead to a concentration on the middle ground, where most votes are found, although in recent years, the two parties in the United States have become increasingly polarized. While the Democratic Party remains divided between its left-liberal, centrist, and more conservative members (the so-called “Blue Dog Democrats”), the Republican Party has become much more consistently conservative.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Multiparty systems, on the other hand, allow more direct expression of divergent interests and provide scope for the representation of radical alternatives. Green Party representatives and representatives of far right or far left parties, found in some European parliaments, are cases in point. However, often no single party can achieve an overall majority, and the resulting government by coalition may lead either to a stalemate (if compromises can’t be made) or to a rapid succession of elections and new governments, none remaining in power for long. The rise of populist authoritarianism in Europe—largely in reaction to unfavorable economic conditions and the influx of millions of refugees from war-torn countries in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_470" title="470"></span>Middle East and North Africa—has resulted in the resurgence of right-wing nationalist parties in Hungary, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Austria, Germany, and even liberal Sweden.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some writers have studied the connection between voting patterns and class differences. Liberal and leftist parties historically have gained the most votes from lower-class voters, whereas conservative and rightist parties often win the vote of the affluent (see, for example, Bartels, 2008; Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 2005; Stonecash, 2000). Although the Democratic Party has tended to appeal more to lower-class groups, and the Republicans have drawn support from the more affluent sectors, the connections are not absolute. In 2012, 63 percent of voters making less than $30,000 supported Obama, but that percentage dropped to 57 percent for voters making between $30,000 and $49,000. For those making $50,000 or more, a majority—53 percent—supported Romney (<i class="italic">New York Times</i>, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">By 2016, however, the relationship between income and voting preference had weakened. The percentage of those earning less than $30,000 who voted for the Democratic candidate (Clinton) dropped from 63 to 53 percent; for those making between $30,000 and $49,000, it dropped from 57 to 51 percent. Unlike four years earlier, however, less than a majority of those earning more than $50,000 (29 percent) voted for the Republican candidate (Trump). “Third party” candidates Jill Stein (Green Party) and Gary Johnson (Libertarian Party) drew roughly 6 percent of the national vote away from both major party candidates, denying either a majority of the votes.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The largest differences in voting preferences, however, had to do with age, race, and education. Younger voters (especially those under 30) overwhelmingly favored Clinton; older voters (over 40) preferred Trump. Only 37 percent of all White voters favored Clinton, compared with 88 percent of Black voters and 65 percent of Latino voters. More highly educated voters strongly favored Clinton, while voters from small towns and rural areas voted strongly for Trump (Gould and Harrington, 2016). Trump, running as an insurgent candidate outside the Republican Party mainstream, was able to tap into many of the same themes that have contributed to the rise of populist authoritarianism in Europe, in particular, the eroding economic fortunes of many working-class Whites, anger over job losses blamed on the offshoring of manufacturing and undocumented immigrant labor, and fear of terrorism.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The reasons that support for Democrats has eroded have been much debated (Bartels, 2006, 2008; Frank, 2004, 2005, 2016). Several factors, however, seem especially important. In all income groups except the poorest, White voters tend to identify as Republican—with the exception of those who belong to <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-unions" href="part0086_split_006.html#unions">unions</a>, who remain more likely to call themselves Democrats. As union membership has declined, so has support for Democrats, and even among households with union members, support for Clinton was considerably lower than it had been for Obama four years earlier (Rosenfeld, 2014; Minchin, 2016; Bump, 2016a). The Democratic Party’s support for free trade and liberal policies on immigration have also resulted in an erosion of support among working-class Whites, many of whom no longer see the Democratic Party as supportive of their interests (Frank, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The 2016 elections signalled a major political realignment in the United States that has carried over to the 2020 election cycle. Bernie Sanders’s strength in the 2016 Democratic primaries, with his strong <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_471" title="471"></span>support among young people—and Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 Republican primaries and the general election—clearly signal among many voters a concern with the status quo in American politics. One national survey of nearly 2,700 people age 18–29 found that three out of five wanted to “help unite, not further divide” America; half believe that the news they get on Facebook is “fake news” (four out of five have Facebook accounts); and 48 percent identify or lean Democratic (compared with 28 percent Republican and 22 percent independent) (Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, 2017).</p>

<section id="political-parties">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Political Parties</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The founders of the American governmental system did not foresee a role for parties in the political order. George Washington recognized that interest groups would develop, but he warned against “the harmful effects of the spirit of party.” Thomas Jefferson echoed these sentiments, but he in fact became the leader of one of the earliest party organizations. The early parties endorsed candidates for Congress, and the subsequent national division of parties spread to the state legislatures. Soon the parties developed into state organizations representing specific interests and points of view. A two-party system was well established by the 1830s, and its fundamental nature has not altered greatly to this day. Building mass support for a party in the United States is difficult because the country is so large and includes so many regional, cultural, and ethnic groups. The parties have all cultivated electoral strength by forging broad regional bases of support and campaigning for very general political ideals.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As measured by levels of membership, party identification, and voting support, both of the major American parties are in decline. In 2002, roughly equal proportions of registered voters identified as Democrats (34 percent) and Republicans (33 percent), with significantly fewer identifying as Independents (26 percent). As of December 2019, the number of self-identified Democrats had dropped to 28 percent. Twenty-eight percent identified as Republicans, while the largest percentage of people (41 percent) described themselves as independents (Gallup, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The decline in party identification reflects a steadily growing distrust of politics among American voters. According to one survey conducted in 2016, only 19 percent of adults reported they could trust the government “always or most of the time.” The reasons for this are many: an economic recession in 2008 that left 1 out of every 10 American workers jobless, followed by a recovery that was widely perceived as mainly benefitting the most affluent Americans; partisan fighting in a strongly divided Congress; growing polarization between the Democratic and Republican parties; and a general decline in the public’s confidence that elected officials are able to represent their interests (Toedtman, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although trust in government has been declining for years (it briefly peaked after 9/11, before continuing its long-term decline), distrust in government achieved force with the rise of the “Tea Party,” a conservative movement strongly identified with the Republican Party that first appeared on the scene in 2009. The Tea Party is not actually a political party; its name comes from the Boston Tea Party protests of 1773, in which the colonists dumped tea into Boston Harbor, protesting British taxes on tea exported to the colonies. The Tea Party is a well-organized social movement opposed to what its adherents viewed as the Obama administration’s excessive interference in <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_472" title="472"></span>the economy, as seen in its efforts to end the recession through federal spending, its partial takeover of failing corporations, and its push for universal health care coverage. According to the Gallup poll, popular support for the Tea Party peaked early in the Obama administration, reached 32 percent in 2010, but, five years later, had fallen to 17 percent (Norman, 2015).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the 2016 elections, the Tea Party played a less prominent role than did the alt-right, a loose organization of far-right groups and individuals who reject mainstream conservative ideas in favor of a belief in economic populism combined with White nationalism—the belief that the economy should be made to work for “ordinary” people, coupled with White supremacy, anti-Semitism, and anti-Islamic beliefs. The alt-right made effective use of social media to advance its ideas and appeal, and it found a home in <i class="italic">Breitbart News</i>, described as “the platform for the alt-right” by its CEO Stephen Bannon (Posner, 2016). Bannon left <i class="italic">Breitbart News</i> to run the Trump campaign in August 2016 and was named a senior adviser to the president following the election. Although he eventually fell out of favor with President Trump, his role in the presidential campaign brought many supporters of the alt-right to Trump campaign rallies, and Bannon is credited with helping to write Trump’s inaugural address, which claimed that “from this day forward, it’s going to be only America first. America first” (Calamur, 2017). The presence of the alt-right reinforced a strong note of populism in the Republican presidential campaign—just as the Bernie Sanders campaign had done during the 2016 Democratic primaries. It also raised concerns about the rise of populist authoritarianism, given its strong right-wing views.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Given the openly racist views of some alt-right groups and members, it is arguable that racism also played an important role in the election, and one widely cited post-election analysis of American National Election Study data bears this out (Wood, 2017). Racism was evident in the two previous presidential elections as well. In 2008, Barack Obama became the first African American to be elected president, winning by a decisive margin (52 to 46 percent) over Republican John McCain. While Obama received 95 percent of the Black vote and 66 percent of the Latino vote, he lost decisively among White voters, 55 percent of whom voted for McCain (Keeter, 2008; Kohut, 2008). The 2012 election between Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney revealed an even more polarized electorate. Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters chose Obama by 93 percent, 71 percent, and 73 percent, respectively, but White voters chose Romney by 59 percent (<i class="italic">Washington Post</i>, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Whether these divisions portend a longer-term shift in American political identifications remains to be seen, although at least one trend would seem to favor Democrats: The United States is predicted to become majority-minority by 2044, at which point non-Hispanic Whites will comprise less than half (47 percent) of the population. This change will result almost entirely from a substantial increase in the historically Democrat-identified Latino population, whose share is projected to increase from less than 18 percent in 2017 to 29 percent in 2060 (Colby and Ortman, 2015). The strong support of young people for Bernie Sanders (and, although to a lesser degree, for Hillary Clinton when she emerged as the Democratic Party candidate) also suggests that the party may become stronger in future national elections, particularly if it can appeal to the strong populist currents that seem to be reshaping American politics.</p>

<section id="interest-groups">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Interest Groups</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Interest groups and lobbying play a distinctive part in American politics. An <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-interest-group" href="part0086_split_006.html#interest-group">interest group</a> is any organization that attempts to persuade elected officials to consider its aims when deciding on legislation. The American Medical Association, the National Organization for Women, and the National Rifle Association are three examples. Some interest groups are national; others are statewide. Some are permanently organized; others are short-lived. <i class="italic">Lobbying</i> is the act of persuading influential officials to vote in favor of a cause or otherwise lend support to the aims of an interest group. The word <i class="italic">lobby</i> originated in the British parliamentary system: In days past, members of Parliament did not have offices, so their business was conducted in the lobbies of the Parliament buildings.</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The U.S. Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 requires all organizations employing lobbyists to register with Congress and to disclose whom they represent, whom they lobby, what they are lobbying for, and how much they are paid. In 2019, more than 11,000 different lobbyists were registered (Center for Responsive Politics [CRP], 2020b). To run as a political candidate is enormously expensive, and interest groups <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_474" title="474"></span>provide much of the funding at all levels of political office. Donald Trump, the 2016 Republican candidate for president, raised roughly $398 million, while Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate, raised nearly twice as much ($768 million). On the other hand, Trump received far greater media coverage throughout the campaign; such “free media” exposure was estimated as worth more than $5.9 billion for Trump, more than twice the $2.8 billion in free media estimated for Clinton. When “outside money” is factored in, including money from political action committees (PACs) that are set up by interest groups to raise and distribute campaign funds, total spending on the 2016 presidential and congressional campaigns is estimated to have exceeded $6.4 billion: nearly $2.4 billion for the presidency, and more than $4 billion for House and Senate seats (Sultan, 2017). It clearly costs a great deal of money to run for office, with the result that national officeholders spend a great deal of their time raising money (in the case of House representatives, who are up for election every two years, fund-raising for the next campaign cycle often begins immediately after the last election).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Incumbents have an enormous advantage in soliciting money. In the 2018 House and Senate elections, incumbents raised one and a half times as much money as their challengers—$1.3 billion compared with $898 million (Center for Responsive Politics, 2020a). Incumbents are preferred as fundraisers partly because they can curry favor with special interests and other contributors, since they are in a position to ensure favorable votes and obtain spending on their contributors’ pet projects and other “pork” for their districts. Incumbency also provides familiarity—a formidable (and costly) obstacle for most challengers to overcome. The cost of elections has increased significantly in the last few decades (see Figure 13.2).</p>

<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_475" title="475"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a narrow 5–4 decision (<i class="italic">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</i>), overturned a 63-year-old law that limited corporate and union spending in elections. The conservative majority on the Court reasoned that corporations and unions were protected under First Amendment free-speech rights, and so were free to spend as much as they chose to express their independent opinions on candidates—so long as these were not coordinated with candidates’ campaigns (Liptak, 2010). This decision has raised concern among liberals that businesses will now be able to saturate the airwaves with political ads during elections, thereby exerting undue influence on voters. This, they reason, will further tip the balance of political influence toward those corporations that have deep pockets. Instead of “one person, one vote,” it will more likely be “one dollar, one vote,” with those having the most dollars able to garner the largest number of votes (Johnson, 2010).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Corporations, which have a strong stake in getting favorable legislation and government contracts, are the largest contributors to campaigns, outspending organized labor by as much as 17 to 1. In the 2016 election cycle, donations from businesses totaled $3.3 billion; donations from organized labor reached only $194 million. While these numbers may somewhat overstate the relative influence of corporations as opposed to labor unions, the overall trend is clear. Business donations narrowly favored Republican candidates over Democrats (51 to 49 percent), while the much smaller donations from organized labor strongly favored Democrats (87 to 13 percent).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Two other sources of funding played a role in the 2016 elections: So-called ideological organizations (mainly single-issue organizations such as the National Rifle Association, EMILY’s List, and Environment for America) donated $460 million, with nearly two-thirds going to Democrats, while a large category of “other” donors (including educators, government employees, nonprofits, religious groups, and retired individuals) accounted for $699 million, with 58 percent going to Democrats (CRP, 2017a). PAC donations accounted for $542 million of total funding, 58 percent going to Republican candidates. The top 20 PACs included 17 corporations and 3 labor unions (CRP, 2017e).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Paid lobbyists play a significant role in influencing the outcome of congressional votes and presidential decisions. The Center for Responsive Politics (CRP, 2017d) reported that businesses, unions, and other advocacy groups spent some $3.1 billion in 2016, employing more than 11,000 lobbyists. The largest sector, health, was the target of $510 million in lobbying efforts, with the pharmaceutical industry accounting for nearly half of that amount. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, broadly representing business interests, was the top spender in 2016 ($104 million), followed by the National Association of Realtors ($65 million). All of the top 20 lobbyists in 2016 represented business interests (CRP, 2017d).</p>
