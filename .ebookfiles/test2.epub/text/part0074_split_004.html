<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">About 6 percent of the population of the United States is of Asian origin. Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans form the largest groups, but now there are also significant numbers of Vietnamese, Koreans, Japanese, and Pakistanis. As a result of the war in Vietnam, some 350,000 refugees from that country alone entered the United States in the 1970s.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most of the early Chinese immigrants settled in California and worked in heavy industries, such as mining and railroad construction. The retreat of the Chinese into distinct Chinatowns was a response to the hostility they faced. Since Chinese immigration was legally banned in 1882, the Chinese remained isolated from the wider society, at least until recently.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The early Japanese immigrants also settled in California and the other Pacific states. During World War II, after the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan, Japanese Americans in the United States were taken to remote “relocation centers” surrounded by barbed wire and gun turrets. Even though most were American citizens, they were compelled to live in the hastily established camps for the duration of the war. Paradoxically, this situation promoted their greater integration within the wider society because, after the war, Japanese Americans did not return to their previously separate neighborhoods. Since then, they have attained high levels of education and income, marginally outstripping Whites. Japanese Americans have the highest rate of intermarriage of U.S. Asian groups: More than half of Japanese newlyweds married a non-Asian partner (Pew Research Center, 2013c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Following the passage of a new immigration act in 1965, large-scale immigration of Asians again took place. Foreign-born Chinese Americans today outnumber those brought up in the United States. The newly arrived Chinese have avoided the Chinatowns in which the long-established Chinese remain.</p>
