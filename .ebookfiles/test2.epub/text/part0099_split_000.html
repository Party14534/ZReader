<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Contemporary research on family formation and family life, both in the United States and worldwide, is unified by four key themes. First, family structure continues to change and evolve. Second, there is tremendous variation in what families look like; our family experiences are powerfully shaped by our social group memberships, including race, social class, religion, sexual orientation, and age. Third, families are an important influence on the health and well-being of both adults and children. And, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_576" title="576"></span>finally, while families have been historically thought of as a safe haven, they also have a dangerous side where family members may inflict abuse and pain on one another. We review recent research on the current state of families and suggest ways they may change in future decades.</p>
