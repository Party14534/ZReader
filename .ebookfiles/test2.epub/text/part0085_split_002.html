<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While pluralists accept that individual citizens can have little or no direct influence on political decision making, they argue that the presence of interest groups can limit the centralization of power in the hands of government officials. According to <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-pluralist-theories-of-modern-democracy" href="part0085_split_004.html#pluralist-theories-of-modern-democracy">pluralist theories of modern democracy</a>, government policies in a democracy are influenced by the continual processes of bargaining among numerous groups representing different interestsâ€”business organizations, trade unions, ethnic groups, environmental organizations, religious groups, and so forth. Competing interest groups or factions are vital to democracy because they divide up power, reducing the exclusive influence <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_464" title="464"></span>of any one group or class (Truman, 1981). A democratic political order involves a balance among competing interests, all having some effect on policy but none dominating the mechanisms of government. Elections are also influenced by this situation; to achieve a majority of votes, the parties must be responsive to diverse interest groups. In the view of pluralist theorists, the United States is one of the most pluralistic of industrialized societies and, therefore, the most democratic. Competition among diverse interest groups occurs not only at the national level but also within the states and in local communities.</p>
