<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Can Medicare and Social Security Survive the “Graying” of America?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The two principal governmental programs that provide financial support for the retirement-age population are Medicare, which was instituted in 1965, and Social Security, whose benefits were increased at about the same time. (The program itself was begun in 1935.) The full benefits of Medicare and Social Security are available at age 65 for current cohorts of older adults, although partial benefits are available to some people a few years earlier. For birth cohorts born in 1960 and later, however, Social Security benefits will start for most people at age 67.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Social Security and Medicare are financed by workers’ payroll deductions, employer contributions, and taxes on those who are self-employed. Working Americans pay into these programs today so they can be eligible for benefits when they are no longer able to earn a living. By providing a degree of economic support for older adults, such programs also make it economically possible to retire; in the absence of the economic security such programs provide, older adults would be under greater economic pressure to continue working as long as they are physically capable. In 2020, about 65 million Americans will received over one trillion dollars in Social Security benefits. About 71 percent of benefits went to retired workers and their dependents; the remainder went to disabled workers and their dependents and to survivors of deceased workers (Social Security Administration, 2020). Although the program was not initially designed to be the sole financial resource for retirees, more than one-third of older adults rely on Social Security for 90 percent or more of their income (Social Security Administration, 2016c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The monthly benefit one receives under Social Security depends in part on earnings before retirement. The average monthly benefit in December 2019 was $1,503 for retired workers and $1,258 for disabled workers (Social Security Administration, 2019). Because retired women are less likely than men to have had continuous paid employment throughout their lives, their average retirement income is typically lower than men’s. As these figures suggest, Social Security provides a minimal level of support for older adults—by itself, barely enough to keep recipients out of poverty (Sullivan, 2012). Still, without such benefits, an estimated three-quarters of all older adults would live in poverty (Carr, 2019).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Medicare is the nation’s largest health insurer, providing health insurance to 55 million Americans. Spending on Medicare totaled $582 billion in 2018, accounting for about 14 percent of the federal budget (Peter G. Peterson Foundation, 2019). Because it reaches so many people, Medicare has made an enormous difference in the aged population’s access to adequate health care—although at a high cost.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Programs such as Social Security and Medicare will become increasingly costly as more and more Americans retire and live long lives after they retire; further, the share of the population funding Social Security is shrinking. As a result, the worker-to-beneficiary ratio has fallen, from 16.5 to 1 in 1950 to 2.8 to 1 in 2015. By 2037, it will be 2.1:1 (Social Security Administration, 2016b; Urban Institute, 2010). There is particular concern over whether the Social Security system will remain financially sound as retiring baby boomers collect their pensions. It is currently expected to have sufficient assets to pay full benefits until at least 2033, although if it is to avoid running out of money in the long run, changes will have to be made in the way the system works.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A variety of solutions have been proposed, including charging co-payments for home health care services, requiring beneficiaries to pay higher premiums, and requiring drug companies to provide discounts (Pear, 2011). One controversial proposal would involve “means testing,” or allocating benefits based on an older person’s financial means and needs. In the past decade, there also have been calls to privatize at least part of Social Security—that is, to enable workers to invest part of their Social Security withholdings in the stock market, rather than simply paying it all into a government fund. The effectiveness of this approach depends, of course, on how well the stock market performs in the future. The future of Social Security and Medicare will likely remain at the center of one of the major political debates of this century.</p>
