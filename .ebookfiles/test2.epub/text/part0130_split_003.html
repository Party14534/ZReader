<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The consequences of globalization are far-reaching, affecting virtually all aspects of the social world. Yet, because globalization is an open-ended and internally contradictory process, it produces outcomes that are difficult to predict and control. Another way of thinking of this dynamic is in terms of risk. Many of the changes wrought by globalization present new forms of risk. Unlike risks from the past, which had established causes and known effects, today’s risks are incalculable in origin and indeterminate in their consequences.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">The Spread of “Manufactured Risk”</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Humans have always had to face risks, but today’s risks are qualitatively different from those of earlier times. Until recently, human societies were threatened by <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-external-risk" href="part0130_split_005.html#external-risk">external risk</a> from the natural world—dangers such as drought, earthquakes, famines, and storms. Today, however, we increasingly face various types of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-manufactured-risk" href="part0130_split_005.html#manufactured-risk">manufactured risk</a>—risks created by the effect of our own knowledge and technology on the natural world. Many current environmental and health risks are the outcomes of our own interventions into nature.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Environmental Risks</b> One of the clearest illustrations of manufactured risk involves threats posed to the natural environment (see <a href="part0121_split_000.html#3JCK20-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 19</a>). A consequence of accelerating industrial and technological development has been the steady spread of human intervention in nature—for example, through urbanization, industrial production and pollution, large-scale agricultural projects, the construction of dams and hydroelectric plants, and nuclear power. The collective outcome of such processes has been widespread environmental destruction whose precise cause is indeterminate and whose consequences are difficult to calculate.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the globalizing world, ecological risk takes many forms. One example of ecological risk is global warming. Concern over global warming has been mounting in the scientific community; it is now generally accepted that Earth’s temperature has been increasing due to the buildup within the atmosphere of greenhouse gases—a by-product of human-made processes such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels. The potential consequences of global warming are devastating: If polar ice caps continue to melt at the current rate, sea levels will rise and may threaten low-lying land masses and their human populations. Changes in climate patterns have been cited as possible causes of the severe floods that afflicted Mozambique in 2000, the record number of hurricanes that swept through the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico in the fall of 2005, as well as Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans, and Hurricane Sandy, which leveled entire neighborhoods in New Jersey and New York in 2012. Most recently, the brushfires in Australia, also linked to climate change, destroyed 27.2 million acres, and are estimated to have killed over 1 billion animals (Zaveri and Rueb, 2020; Woodward, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because environmental risks are diffuse in origin, it is unclear how to address them or determine who bears responsibility for remedying them. For example, although scientists have found that chemical pollution levels have harmed Antarctic penguin colonies, it is impossible to identify either the exact origins of the pollution or its possible consequences for the penguins in the future. In such an instance—and in hundreds of similar cases—action to address the risk is unlikely because the extent of both the cause and the outcome is unknown (Beck, 1995).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Health Risks</b> Lately, the dangers posed to human health by manufactured risks have attracted great attention. The media and public health campaigns, for example, urge people to limit their exposure to harmful <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_841" title="841"></span>ultraviolet rays and apply sunscreen to prevent burning. Sun exposure has been linked to a heightened risk of skin cancer, possibly due to the depletion of the ozone layer—the layer of Earth’s atmosphere that normally filters out ultraviolet light. Because of the high volume of chemical emissions produced by human activities and industry, the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere has been diminishing, and, in some cases, ozone holes have opened up.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many examples of manufactured risk are linked to food, because advances in science and technology have heavily influenced modern farming and food production techniques. For example, chemical pesticides and herbicides are widely used in commercial agriculture, and chickens, pigs, and many other animals raised for food are pumped full of hormones and antibiotics. Some people have suggested that such farming techniques compromise food safety and could adversely affect humans. Two particular controversies have raised widespread public concern: the debate over genetically modified foods and the outbreak of mad cow disease.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The saga of genetically modified foods began 20 years ago, when some of the world’s leading chemical and agricultural firms decided that new knowledge about genes could transform the world’s food supply. These companies had been making pesticides and herbicides but wanted to develop a major market for the future. The American firm Monsanto was the leader in developing much of the new technology. Monsanto bought up seed companies, sold off its chemical division, worked to bring the new crops to market, and launched a gigantic advertising campaign promoting the benefits of its genetically modified crops to farmers and consumers. The early responses were just as the company had confidently anticipated. By early 1999, 55 percent of the soybeans and 35 percent of the corn produced in the United States contained genetic alterations. From 1996 to 2016, genetically modified foods experienced an unprecedented 110-fold increase in worldwide production (International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is currently estimated that upward of 75 percent of all processed foods sold in grocery stores contain some genetically modified components (Center for Food Safety, 2017). In addition to North America, genetically modified crops are being widely grown in China. Since genetically modified crops are relatively new, no one can be certain about their effects once they are introduced into the environment. Many ecological and consumer groups are concerned about the potential risks involved with the adoption of this largely untested technology.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), known popularly as mad cow disease, was first detected in British cattle in 1986. Scientists have linked BSE infection to the practice of raising cattle, normally herbivores, on feed containing traces of the parts of other animals. After the outbreak, the British government took steps to control the disease among cattle, but it claimed that eating beef was safe for humans. Only in the mid-1990s was it admitted that several human deaths from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a degenerative brain condition, had been linked to the consumption of beef from infected cattle. Thousands of British cattle were killed, and strict new legislation was passed to regulate cattle farming and the sale of beef products. Most recently, cattle infected with BSE have been discovered in Canada and the United States, sparking widespread fears about the safety of the food supply.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_842" title="842"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although extensive scientific research has explored the risks to humans from BSE, the findings remain inconclusive. There is a risk that individuals who consumed British beef in the years preceding the discovery of BSE may have been exposed to infection. Calculating the risks to humans from BSE is an example of the complexity of risk assessment in the contemporary world. It is necessary to know if and when infected cattle were part of a certain food chain, the level and distribution of the infection present in the cattle, how the beef was processed, and many other details. The sheer quantity of unknown factors has complicated the task.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">The Global “Risk Society”</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Global warming, the debate over genetically modified foods, the BSE crisis, and other manufactured risks present new choices and challenges. Individuals, countries, and transnational organizations must negotiate risks as they make choices about how to live and conduct business. Because there are no definitive answers about the causes and outcomes of such risks, this endeavor can be bewildering. Should we use food and raw materials if their production or consumption might harm our health and the natural environment?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">German sociologist Ulrich Beck (1992) sees these risks contributing to a global “risk society.” As technological change progresses and produces new forms of risk, we must constantly respond and adjust to these changes. The risk society, he argues, is not limited to environmental and health risks; it includes a series of interrelated changes within contemporary social life: shifting employment patterns, heightened job insecurity, the declining influence of tradition and custom on self-identity, the erosion of traditional family patterns, and the democratization of personal relationships. Because personal futures are much less fixed than they were in traditional societies, decisions of all kinds present risks. Getting married, for example, is a riskier endeavor today than when marriage was a lifelong institution. Decisions about educational qualifications and career paths can also feel risky: It is difficult to predict what skills will be valuable in an economy that is changing so rapidly.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to Beck (1995), an important aspect of the risk society is that its hazards are not restricted spatially, temporally, or socially. Today’s risks have global, not merely personal, consequences. Many forms of manufactured risk, such as those concerning human health and the environment, cross national boundaries. Consider the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011. Everyone living in the immediate vicinity—regardless of age, class, gender, or status—was exposed to dangerous levels of radiation.</p>
