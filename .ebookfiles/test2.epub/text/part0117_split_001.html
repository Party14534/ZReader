<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The types of illnesses from which individuals suffer, the treatments available for these conditions, and the very ways we think about “causes” of illness have changed dramatically throughout human history. The hunting and gathering communities of the Americas, before the arrival of the Europeans, were not as susceptible to infectious disease as the European societies of the period. Many infectious organisms thrive only when human populations live above the density level that is characteristic of hunting and gathering life. The highest population density among hunter-gatherer communities was 22 people per square mile among the Chumash people; to put this in perspective, in 2019 there were 929 people per every square mile in the United States overall, and more than 27,000 in New York City (Erlandson et al., 2001; World Population Review, 2020). Permanently settled communities, particularly large cities, risk the contamination of water supplies by waste products. Hunters and gatherers were less vulnerable in this respect because they moved continuously across the countryside.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">During the colonial era, efforts to bring Western ideals to developing societies also brought certain diseases into other parts of the world. Smallpox, measles, and typhus, among other major maladies, were unknown to the indigenous populations of Central and South America before the Spanish conquest in the early sixteenth century. English and French colonists brought the same diseases to North America (Dubos, 1959). Some of these illnesses produced epidemics that ravaged or completely wiped out native populations, which had little or no resistance to them.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In Africa and subtropical parts of Asia, infectious diseases have been rife for a long time. Tropical and subtropical conditions are especially conducive to diseases such as malaria, carried by mosquitoes, and sleeping sickness, carried by the tsetse fly. Historians believe that risk from infectious diseases was lower in Africa and Asia before <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_718" title="718"></span>Europeans tried to colonize these regions, since colonists often brought with them practices that negatively affected the health of local natives. The threat of epidemics, drought, or natural disaster always loomed, but colonialism led to major unforeseen changes in the relation between populations and their environments, producing harmful effects on health patterns. The Europeans introduced new farming methods, upsetting the ecology of whole regions. For example, before the Europeans’ arrival, Africans successfully maintained large herds of cattle in East Africa. Changes introduced by the intruders allowed for the multiplication and uncontrolled spread of the tsetse fly, which carries illnesses that are fatal to both humans and livestock. Today, large areas of East Africa are completely devoid of cattle (Kjekshus, 1977).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The most significant consequence of the colonial system was its effect on nutrition and, therefore, on levels of resistance to illness as a result of the changed economic conditions involved in producing for world markets. In many parts of Africa, the nutritional quality of native diets became substantially depressed as cash crop production supplanted the production of native foods.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This was not a one-way process, however. Indeed, early colonialism also radically changed Western diets, having a paradoxical impact in terms of health. On the one hand, Western diets benefited from the addition of new foods, such as bananas, pineapples, and grapefruit. On the other hand, the importation of tobacco, together with raw sugar (which found uses in all manner of foods), has had harmful consequences. Thus, the diseases from which we suffer are shaped by not only human biology but also complex macrosocial influences such as globalization, colonialism, and the development of technologies that foster the growth of particular crops.</p>
