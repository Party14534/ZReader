<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In many social situations, we engage in what Goffman calls <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-unfocused-interaction" href="part0035_split_008.html#unfocused-interaction">unfocused interaction</a> with others. Unfocused interaction takes place whenever individuals exhibit awareness of one another’s presence. This is usually the case anywhere large numbers of people are assembled, as on a busy street, in a theater crowd, or at a party. When people are in the presence of others, even if they do not directly talk to them, they continually communicate nonverbally through their posture and facial and physical gestures.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-focused-interaction" href="part0035_split_008.html#focused-interaction">Focused interaction</a> occurs when individuals directly attend to what others say or do. Goffman calls an instance of focused interaction an <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-encounter" href="part0035_split_008.html#encounter">encounter</a>. Much of our day-to-day life consists of encounters with other people—family, friends, colleagues—frequently occurring against the background of unfocused interaction with others. Small talk, seminar discussions, games, and routine face-to-face contact (with ticket clerks, waiters, shop assistants, and so forth) are all examples of encounters.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Encounters always need “openings,” which indicate that civil inattention is being discarded. When strangers meet and begin to talk at a party, the moment of ceasing civil inattention is always risky because misunderstandings can easily occur about the nature of the encounter being established (Goffman, 1971). Hence, making eye contact may first be ambiguous and tentative. A person can then act as though he or she had made no direct move if the overture is not accepted. In focused interaction, each person communicates as much by facial expression and gesture as by the words actually exchanged.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Goffman distinguishes between the expressions an individual “gives” and those he “gives off.” The first are the words and facial expressions <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_144" title="144"></span>people use to make certain impressions on others. The second are the cues that others may spot to check a person’s sincerity or truthfulness. For instance, a restaurant owner listens with a polite smile to the statements of customers about how much they are enjoying their meal. At the same time, he is noting how pleased they seemed to be while eating the food, whether a lot is left over, and the tone of voice they use to express their satisfaction.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Think about how Goffman’s concepts of focused and unfocused interaction, developed mainly to explain face-to-face social encounters, apply to the current age. Can you think of a way in which unfocused interaction occurs on Facebook or Twitter? In some of these online communities, anyone can have an awareness of who else is online without being in direct contact with them. On Twitter, people are constantly broadcasting status updates about what they are doing at that moment. These status updates make it possible for people in unfocused interaction to have even more control over how they are perceived than people who are merely in one another’s presence. Instead of unconsciously revealing their facial expressions or posture as they would in face-to-face encounters, people can consciously craft the message or tweet they wish to broadcast.</p>
