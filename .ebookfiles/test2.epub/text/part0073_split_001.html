<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Defining Racism</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-racism" href="part0073_split_003.html#racism">Racism</a> can be defined in many ways. Just as there are different understandings of what constitutes racism in different national and subnational contexts and historical periods, so there are similar variations in the understanding of racism. Racism can refer to explicit beliefs in racial supremacy, such as the systems established in Nazi Germany, before the civil rights movement in the United States, and under apartheid in South Africa. It can also refer to practices such as stereotyping that keep racial minorities in inferior positions, despite apparent good will and beliefs in equality. Two main components of racism are prejudice and discrimination.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Prejudice and Discrimination</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-prejudice" href="part0073_split_003.html#prejudice">Prejudice</a> refers to opinions or attitudes held by members of one group toward another. These preconceived views are often based on hearsay and are resistant to change even in the face of direct evidence or new information. People may harbor favorable prejudices toward groups with which they identify and negative prejudices against others. Prejudice operates mainly through <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-stereotyping" href="part0073_split_003.html#stereotyping">stereotyping</a>, which means thinking in terms of fixed and inflexible categories. Stereotyping is often closely linked to the psychological mechanism of displacement, in which feelings of hostility or anger are directed against objects that are not at the root of those feelings. Stereotyping leads people to blame <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-scapegoats" href="part0073_split_003.html#scapegoats">scapegoats</a> for problems that are not their fault. Scapegoating is common when two deprived ethnic groups compete with one another for economic rewards. People who direct racial attacks against poor Mexicans or African Americans, for example, are often in a similar economic position to them. They blame Blacks or Mexicans for grievances whose real causes lie elsewhere.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Scapegoating is normally directed against groups that are relatively powerless because they make for easy targets. Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Italians, racial minorities, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_382" title="382"></span>others have played the unwilling role of scapegoat at various times throughout Western history. Scapegoating frequently involves <i class="italic">projection</i>, the unconscious attribution to others of one’s own desires or characteristics. For example, research has consistently demonstrated that when members of a dominant group practice violence against a minority and exploit it sexually, they are likely to believe that the minority group itself displays traits of sexual violence. In the United States, before the civil rights movement, for instance, some White men’s ideas about the lustful nature of African American men probably originated in their own frustrations, since sexual access to White women was limited by the formal nature of courtship. Similarly, in apartheid South Africa, Black males were thought to be sexually dangerous to White women—but, in fact, virtually all criminal sexual contact was initiated by White men against Black women (Simpson and Yinger, 1986).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In contrast to prejudice, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-discrimination" href="part0073_split_003.html#discrimination">discrimination</a> refers to actual behavior that denies to members of a particular group resources or rewards that others can obtain. College admissions officers have been known to discriminate against members of ethnic or racial groups when those members do not conform with stereotypes of those groups. One investigation of the Princeton University admissions office, for example, uncovered a rejected Hispanic applicant with this comment written on her file: “Tough to see putting her ahead of others. No cultural flavor in app.” Such attitudes are racist when they function to keep Hispanics out of college or ensure that only certain “kinds” of Hispanics will gain access to institutions of higher learning.</p>
