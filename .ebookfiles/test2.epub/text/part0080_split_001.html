<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Who Are America’s Older Adults?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Older adults reflect the diversity of U.S. society that we’ve noted elsewhere in this textbook: They are rich, poor, and in between; they belong to all racial and ethnic groups; they live alone and in families of various sorts; they vary in their political views; and they are gay and lesbian as well as heterosexual. Furthermore, like other Americans, they are diverse with respect to health: Although some suffer from mental and physical disabilities, most lead active, independent lives.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A portrait of older Americans reveals that Whites are overrepresented among persons age 65 and older. Fully 77 percent of Americans age 65 and older in 2016 were non-Hispanic White, just 9 percent were Black, 8 percent Hispanic (of any race), 4 percent Asian/Pacific Islander, and 0.5 percent Native American (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2017j). These statistics reflect both Whites’ longer life expectancy relative to Blacks and the fact that many older Latino immigrants return to their home countries in later life so that they can spend their final years with their families.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Currently, over 13.9 percent of the age 65+ population in the United States are foreign born (Mizoguchi et al., 2019). In California, New York, Hawaii, and other states that receive large numbers of immigrants, as many as one-fifth of the older population were born outside the United States (Shin and Kominski, 2010). Most older immigrants either do not speak English well or do not speak it at all. Integrating older immigrants into U.S. society poses special challenges: Some are highly educated, but most are not. Most lack a retirement income, so they depend on their families or public assistance for support. Linguistic isolation also is a concern, for those who live with family members or in neighborhoods where few people share their language (Gubernskaya and Treas, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Finally, as people live to increasingly older ages, the age 65+ population is becoming diverse in terms of age itself. It is useful to distinguish among different age categories of the old, such as the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-young-old" href="part0080_split_008.html#young-old">young old</a> (ages 65 to 74), the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-old-old" href="part0080_split_008.html#old-old">old old</a> (ages 75 to 84), and the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-oldest-old" href="part0080_split_008.html#oldest-old">oldest old</a> (ages 85 and older). The young old are most likely to be economically independent, healthy, active, and engaged; the oldest old, the fastest-growing segment of the older population, are most likely to encounter difficulties such as poor health, financial insecurity, isolation, and loneliness. As the COVID-19 pandemic revealed, oldest old adults accounted for a vastly disproportionate share of deaths, a function not solely of biological aging, but due to the fact that they were more likely to live in congregate living situations like long-term care facilities (Gardner, States, and Bagley, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Social, economic, and psychological differences among the young, old, and oldest old are not due only to the effects of aging; they may also reflect one’s birth cohort. The young old came of age during the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_432" title="432"></span>post–World War II period of strong economic growth and benefited as a result: They are more likely to be educated; to have acquired wealth in the form of a home, savings, or investments; and to have had many years of stable employment. These advantages are much less likely to be enjoyed by the oldest old, partly because their education and careers began at an earlier time, when economic conditions were not so favorable and medical technologies were less well developed (Alwin, 2008; Idler, 1993; Manton et al., 2008).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What is the experience of growing old in the United States today? Although older adults do face some special challenges, especially in the face of pandemic, many lead healthy, satisfying, and socially engaged lives (Carr, 2019). In this section, we describe contemporary sociological studies that document differences among aged population in the United States, and we investigate some of the common problems that they confront. In the next section, we delve into several debates about the impact of aging on society, and the ways that older persons, governments, and societies can adjust and adapt to the challenges of population aging.</p>
