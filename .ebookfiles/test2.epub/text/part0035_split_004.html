<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Social interaction requires numerous forms of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-nonverbal-communication" href="part0035_split_008.html#nonverbal-communication">nonverbal communication</a>—the exchange of information and meaning through facial expressions, gestures, and body movements. Nonverbal communication, sometimes called “body language,” often alters or expands on what is said with words. In some cases, our body language may convey a message that is at odds with our words.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Face, Gestures, and Emotion</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One major aspect of communication is the facial expression of emotion. Paul Ekman and his colleagues have developed what they call the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) for describing movements of the facial muscles <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_140" title="140"></span>that give rise to particular expressions (Ekman and Friesen, 1978). By this means, they have tried to inject some precision into an area notoriously open to inconsistent or contradictory interpretations—for there is little agreement about how emotions are to be identified and classified. Charles Darwin, one of the originators of evolutionary theory, claimed that basic modes of emotional expression are the same in all human beings. Although some have disputed the claim, Ekman’s research among people from widely different cultural backgrounds seems to confirm Darwin’s view. Ekman and W. V. Friesen carried out a study of an isolated community in New Guinea whose members had previously had virtually no contact with outsiders. When they were shown pictures of facial expressions conveying six emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise), the New Guineans were able to identify these emotions.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">Paul Ekman’s photographs of facial expressions from a tribesman in an isolated community in New Guinea helped test the idea that basic modes of emotional expression are the same among all people. Here the instructions were to show how your face would look if (clockwise from top left) your friend had come and you were happy; your child had died; you saw a dead pig that had been lying there a long time; you were angry and about to fight.</figcaption>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to Ekman, the results of his own and similar studies of different peoples support the view that the facial expression of emotion and its interpretation are innate in human beings. He acknowledges that his evidence does not conclusively demonstrate this view, and it may be that widely shared cultural-learning experiences are involved; however, his conclusions are supported by other types of research. Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1972) studied six children born deaf and blind to see to what extent their facial expressions were the same as those of sighted and hearing individuals in particular emotional situations. He found that the children smiled when engaged in obviously pleasurable activities, raised their eyebrows in surprise when sniffing at an object with an unaccustomed smell, and frowned when repeatedly offered a disliked object. Because the children could not have seen other people behaving in these ways, it seems that these responses must be innately determined.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Using the FACS, Ekman and Friesen identified a number of the discrete facial-muscle actions in newborn infants that are also found in adult expressions of emotion. Infants seem, for example, to produce facial expressions similar to the adult expression of disgust (pursing the lips and frowning) in response to sour tastes. But <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_141" title="141"></span>although the facial expression of emotion seems to be partly innate, individual and cultural factors influence what exact form facial movements take and the contexts in which they are deemed appropriate. How people smile—for example, the precise movement of the lips and other facial muscles—and for how long both vary among cultures.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">No gestures or bodily postures have been shown to characterize all, or even most, cultures. In some societies, for instance, people nod when they mean no, the opposite of Anglo-American practice. Gestures that Americans tend to use a great deal, such as pointing, seem not to exist among certain peoples (Bull, 1983). Similarly, a straightened forefinger placed in the center of the cheek and rotated is used in parts of Italy as a gesture of praise but appears to be unknown elsewhere.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Like facial expressions, gestures and bodily posture are continually used to fill out utterances and convey meanings when nothing is actually said. All three can be used to joke, show irony, or express skepticism. The nonverbal impressions that we convey often inadvertently indicate that what we say is not quite what we actually mean. Blushing is perhaps the most obvious example, but innumerable other subtle indicators can be picked up by other people. Genuine facial expressions tend to evaporate after four or five seconds. A smile that lasts longer could indicate deceit. An expression of surprise that lasts too long may indicate deliberate sarcasm—to show that the individual is not, in fact, surprised after all.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">On the Internet, it is very difficult to capture dimensions of emotion that are present only with facial expression. At first, the need that Internet users felt to approximate facial gestures resulted in at least two common faces:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">:) or :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As time passed, a need for greater subtlety resulted in other widely understood variations, such as this winking smiley face:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">;-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Email may once have been devoid of facial expression, but today, the average email user expects to insert different emotions into a message. Strongly felt sentiments might be typed in all capitals, a gesture that is considered “shouting.” The strong need that human beings feel to communicate with their faces has also led to other innovations, like Skype and FaceTime. But, in general, people who communicate over the Internet or even the phone lack the benefit of seeing the faces of their conversational partners as they speak.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Why and how does this lack of face-to-face contact matter for human relationships and interactions? On the phone, whether it’s a cell phone or landline, an individual will frequently talk for a longer stretch of time than he or she would in face-to-face conversation. Unable to see the face of a conversational partner, the speaker can’t as readily adjust what he or she is saying in response to clues from the listener that he or she “gets it.” Yet, the phone maintains at least some immediacy of feedback that email and text messages, to a lesser extent, lack. This is why in email disputes, people who <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_142" title="142"></span>are unable to make mutual adjustments in response to verbal or facial cues will end up saying much more—communicated in the form of long messages—than they would need to say in spoken conversation.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Which is best? Would you prefer to make your point via email or text message, over the phone or Skype, or in person? Using sociological insights such as these might make you prefer electronic communication at some times and face-to-face communication at others. For example, if you are dealing with a powerful person and want to get your thoughts across, you may want to avoid a situation where the person can signal with facial gestures that your idea is silly and thus intimidate you, inhibiting you from making all your points. The power to signal with facial gestures is one of the things people do to control the flow of a conversation. On the other hand, face-to-face communication gives you an opportunity to try out an idea on someone more powerful than you without going too far down the road if the person is actually unreceptive.</p>
