<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Hunger and Malnutrition</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Hunger and malnutrition are major global sources of poor health. Problems of inadequate food are nothing new. What seems to be new is their pervasiveness—the fact <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_309" title="309"></span>that so many people in the world today are on the brink of starvation (Global Map 9.2). As previously noted, The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 822 million people worldwide, or roughly one in nine, are chronically undernourished, virtually all of them in developing countries. FAO defines undernourishment as a diet of 1,800 calories or less a day, the minimal number of calories (on average) required to provide adults with the nutrients required for active, healthy lives. (Of course, what is eaten is also a key determinant of health; one can have a high-calorie diet that lacks the required nutrients for good health.) The good news is that the number of chronically undernourished people has declined by 35 million over the past decade. The bad news is that all of the decline (72 million people) had occurred by 2015; since then the number has increased by 37 million (UN FAO, 2020b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most hunger today is the result of a combination of natural and social forces. As of 2018, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization had listed 33 countries in Africa, the Middle East, Central and South Asia, the Pacific, and the Caribbean as in need of external food assistance due to severe weather- and conflict-related food shortages. More than half of the world’s hungry are found in Asia and the Pacific; about a quarter are in sub-Saharan Africa. In 21 of these countries, conflict is the major problem: In Syria, for example, a long and violent civil war has left 85 percent of the population in poverty; nearly 7 million people are “acutely food insecure” and in need of urgent assistance (UN FAO, 2019b). Moreover, conditions are predicted to worsen considerably as a result of global climate change, which will significantly impact agricultural production, especially in the world’s poorest countries. Absent a concerted effort by all countries to limit greenhouse gas production, the worst-case scenario estimates that an additional 165 million people would be plunged into extreme poverty by 2030 (UN FAO, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The countries affected by malnutrition are too poor to pay for new technologies that would increase food production. Nor can they afford sufficient food imports. As world hunger grows, the largest increases in food production occur where hunger is not a pervasive problem, while the poorest countries—those most in need of food—suffer from the lowest food production gains (Bjerga, 2017). In much of Africa, for example, food production per person has declined. Surplus food produced in high-income countries such as the United States is seldom affordable to the countries that need it most.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The HIV/AIDS epidemic has also contributed to food shortages and hunger, killing many working-age adults. There is evidence that the high rates of HIV infection in many African countries reflect the weakened health of impoverished people, especially children. UNAIDS estimates that since the beginning of the epidemic, some 75 million people around the world have been infected and 32 million have died. Roughly 38 million people are currently living with HIV/AIDS, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa. Two-thirds of new HIV infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, as devastating as HIV/AIDS can be, there is good news as well. Better understanding of the causes and prevention of the disease, along with the development of antiviral medications that enable people to live with the infection, have reduced both the incidence of new cases as well as deaths among HIV-positive people. Globally, new HIV infections have fallen by nearly 40 percent since 2000, and the number of AIDS-related deaths has dropped by 56 percent since the disease’s peak in 2005 (UNAIDS, 2019a).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Hunger is a global problem, although it is disproportionately found in the poorest regions of the world. It is estimated that 822 million people worldwide are chronically undernourished, the vast majority of which were in developing countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, which suffers from the highest rates of undernourishment, almost one in four people are hungry.</p>
