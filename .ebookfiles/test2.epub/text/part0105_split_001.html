<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Macrosocial Influences on Student Outcomes: Do Schools and Neighborhoods Matter?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many of us believe that if we are intelligent and hardworking, and receive encouragement from our teachers, parents, and peers, we can succeed in school. This belief is true—to a point—but the types of schools we attend, the types of classes we take, and the experiences we have within those schools also may affect our lives. The notion that schools may matter dates back to the classic studies of sociologist James Coleman in the 1960s. The ways that schools shape our daily lives both today and in our futures have been documented dramatically by author Jonathan Kozol. Yet a large and controversial body of research on school tracking emphasizes that even within a single school, one’s outcomes are powerfully shaped by the types of classes to which one is assigned.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Coleman’s Study of Between-School Effects in American Education</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The study of “between-school effects,” or the ways students’ experiences at School A differ from those at School B, has been the focus of sociological research for more than five decades. One of the classic investigations of educational inequality was undertaken in the United States in the 1960s. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 required the commissioner of education to prepare a report on educational inequalities resulting from differences in ethnic background, religion, and national origin. James Coleman, a sociologist, was appointed director of the research program. The outcome was a study based on one of the most extensive research projects ever carried out in sociology (Coleman et al., 1966).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Information was collected on more than half a million pupils who were given a range of achievement tests assessing verbal and nonverbal abilities, reading levels, and mathematical skills. Sixty thousand teachers also completed forms providing data for about 4,000 schools. The report found that a large majority of children went to schools <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_624" title="624"></span>that effectively segregated Black students from White students. Almost 80 percent of schools attended by White students contained only 10 percent or fewer African American students. White and Asian American students scored higher on achievement tests than did Blacks and other ethnic minority students. Coleman had supposed his results would also show that predominantly African American schools had worse facilities, larger classes, and more inferior buildings than predominantly White schools. But, surprisingly, the results showed far fewer differences of this type than had been anticipated.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Coleman, therefore, concluded that the material resources provided in schools made little difference to educational performance; the decisive influence was the children’s backgrounds. The report stated, “Inequalities imposed on children by their home, neighborhood, and peer environment are carried along to become the inequalities with which they confront adult life at the end of school” (Coleman et al., 1966). However, some evidence suggested that students from deprived backgrounds who formed close friendships with those from more favorable circumstances were likely to be more successful educationally.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Not long after Coleman’s study, Christopher Jencks and coworkers (1972) produced an equally celebrated work that reviewed empirical evidence accumulated on education and inequality up to the end of the 1960s. Jencks reaffirmed two of the earlier study’s conclusions: First, educational and occupational attainment are governed mainly by family background and non-school factors, and second, on their own, educational reforms can produce only minor effects on existing inequalities. Jencks’s work has been criticized on methodological grounds, but the study’s overall conclusions remain persuasive. Subsequent research has tended to confirm them.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Children Left Behind</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Between 1988 and 1990, the journalist Jonathan Kozol studied schools in about 30 neighborhoods around the United States. He used no special logic in choosing the schools, except that he went where he happened to know teachers, principals, or ministers. What startled him most was the segregation within these schools and the inequalities among them. Kozol brought these terrible conditions to the attention of the American people in his books, including <i class="italic">Savage Inequalities</i> (1991) and <i class="italic">Amazing Grace</i> (1995).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In his passionate opening chapter of <i class="italic">Savage Inequalities</i>, Kozol first took readers to East St. Louis, Illinois, a city that was 98 percent Black, had no regular trash collection, and had few jobs. Three-quarters of its residents were living on welfare at the time. City residents were forced to use their backyards as garbage dumps, which attracted a plague of flies and rats during the hot summer months. One resident told Kozol about “rats as big as puppies” that lived in his mother’s yard. City residents also contended with fumes from two major chemical plants in the city. Another public health problem resulted from raw sewage, which regularly backed up into people’s homes. East St. Louis had some of the sickest children in the United States, with extremely high rates of infant death, asthma, and poor nutrition and extremely low rates of immunization. Only 55 percent of the children had been fully immunized for polio, diphtheria, measles, and whooping cough. Among the city’s other social problems were crime, dilapidated housing, poor health care, and lack of education.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_625" title="625"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Kozol showed how the problems of the city often spilled over into the schools—in this case, literally. Over the course of two weeks, raw sewage backed up into the school on three occasions, each time requiring the evacuation of students and the cancellation of classes. Kozol documented other problems, which he argued stemmed from inadequate and disparate funding. Teachers often had to hold classes without chalk or paper. One teacher commented, “Our problems are severe. I don’t even know where to begin. I have no materials with the exception of a single textbook given to each child. If I bring in anything else—books or tapes or magazines—I bring it in myself. The high school has no VCRs. They are such a crucial tool. So many good things run on public television. I can’t make use of anything I see unless I unhook my VCR and bring it into school. The AV equipment in the school is so old that we are pressured not to use it.” Comments from students reflected the same concerns. “I don’t go to physics class, because my lab has no equipment,” one student said. Another added, “The typewriters in my typing class don’t work.” Only 55 percent of the students in this high school ultimately graduate, about one-third of whom go on to college.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Kozol also wrote about the other end of the inequality spectrum, taking readers into a wealthy suburban school in Westchester County, outside New York City. This school had 96 computers for the 546 students. Most students studied a foreign language for four or five years. Two-thirds of the senior class were enrolled in an advanced placement (AP) class. Kozol visited an AP class to ask students about their perceptions of inequalities within the educational system. Students at this school were well aware of the economic advantages that they enjoyed at both home and school. In regard to their views about less-privileged students, the general consensus was that equal spending among schools was a worthy goal, but it would probably make little difference because poor students lacked motivation and would fail because of other problems. These students also realized that equalizing spending could have adverse effects on their school. As one student said, “If you equalize the money, someone’s got to be short-changed. I don’t doubt that [poor] children are getting a bad deal. But do we want <i class="italic">everyone</i> to get a mediocre education?”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">More than two decades later, Kozol went back and revisited the neighborhoods and children he studied to find out what had happened to them. His portraits are often depressing, with many of the children growing up to be troubled adults. Their lives often were derailed by alcohol abuse, unwanted pregnancies, murders, prison time, and even death by suicide. Yet Kozol did find that a handful of the students succeeded despite the odds. Most of these resilient children had been fortunate to have especially devoted parents, support from their religious community, or a serendipitous scholarship opportunity. As Kozol noted, “These children had unusual advantages: someone intervened in every case.” For example, one young girl named Pineapple, whom Kozol met when she was a kindergartner, went on to graduate from college and become a social worker. Pineapple had attended a school that Kozol described as “almost always in a state of chaos because so many teachers did not stay for long.” A local minister helped her get scholarships to private schools. The daughter of Spanish-speaking immigrants, Pineapple had to work hard to overcome deficits in reading, writing, and basic study skills, but she and her older sister both went on to become the first generation of their family to finish high school and attend college (Kozol, 2012).</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">School funding typically comes from local property taxes, which means schools in poorer areas receive less money.</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While the personal tales of Pineapple and her sister are inspiring, Kozol’s analyses reveal that very little has improved in the past two decades. For example, there remain vast disparities in educational spending in largely Black and Latino central cities versus largely White well-to-do suburbs. He reported that in 2002–2003, New York City spent $11,627 on each public school child, while in Nassau County, the towns of Manhasset and Great Neck spent $22,311 and $19,705, respectively. These patterns weren’t limited to the New York area but rather were found throughout the United States. Because school funding tends to come from local property taxes, wealthier areas generate more funding for schools, while poorer neighborhoods with few lavish private homes have far less money for schools. As with his earlier studies of East St. Louis, Kozol visited schools that were just a few miles apart geographically but that offered vastly different educational opportunities. While suburban White schools would offer advanced math, literature, and an array of arts electives, the nearby primarily Black school would offer classes like hairdressing, typing, and auto shop. Ten years later, the situation hadn’t changed: In 2019, the Chicago Ridge School District, where two-thirds of students come from low-income families, spent $10,987 per child. Less than an hour north, in a wealthy Chicago suburb, the Rondout District spent $31,491 per student (Illinois State Board of Education, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Kozol’s poignant journalistic account of educational inequality has become part of our nation’s conventional wisdom on the subject of educational inequality. But many sociologists have argued that although Kozol’s book (1991) is a moving portrait, it provides an inaccurate and incomplete view of educational inequality. Why would Kozol’s research not be compelling? There are several reasons, including the unsystematic way <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_627" title="627"></span>in which he chose the schools he studied. Other sociologists have proposed a variety of theories and identified myriad factors contributing to inequality and differential outcomes.</p>

<section id="tracking-and-within-school-effects">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Tracking and Within-School Effects</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Kozol’s work vividly revealed the vast disparities between schools found in wealthy versus impoverished school districts. Yet sociologists are also interested in inequalities even within a single school. The practice of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-tracking" href="part0105_split_006.html#tracking">tracking</a>, also known as ability grouping—dividing students into groups that receive different instruction on the basis of assumed similarities in ability or attainment—is common in American schools. In some schools, students are tracked only for certain subjects; in others, for all subjects. Sociologists have long believed that tracking is entirely negative in its effects and that its use partly explains why schooling seems to have little effect on existing social inequalities, since being placed in a particular track labels a student as either able or otherwise. As we have seen in the case of labeling and deviance, once attached, such labels are hard to break away from. Children from more privileged backgrounds, in which academic work is encouraged, are likely to find themselves in the higher tracks early on—and by and large stay there.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A now-classic study by Jeannie Oakes (1985) examined tracking in 25 junior and senior high schools, both large and small and in both urban and rural areas. She concentrated on differences within schools rather than between them. She found that although several schools claimed they did not track students, virtually all of them had mechanisms for sorting students into groups that seemed to be alike in ability and achievement, to make teaching easier. In other words, they employed tracking but did not choose to use the term <i class="italic">tracking</i>. Even where tracking existed only in this informal fashion, Oakes found strong labels developing—“high ability,” “low-achieving,” “slow,” “average,” and so on. Individual students in these groups came to be defined by teachers, other students, and themselves in terms of such labels. A student in a “high-achieving” group was considered a high-achieving person—smart and quick. Pupils in a “low-achieving” group came to be seen as slow, below average—or, in more colloquial terms, as “dummies.” What was the effect of tracking on students in the low group? A subsequent study by Oakes (1990) found that these students received a poorer education in terms of the quality of the courses, teachers, and textbooks made available to them. Moreover, the negative effect of tracking affected mostly African American, Latino, and poor students.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The usual reason given for tracking is that bright children learn more quickly and effectively in a group of others who are equally able and that clever students are held back if placed in mixed groups. Surveying the evidence, Oakes attempted to show that these assumptions are wrong. The results of later research investigations are not wholly consistent, but a path-breaking study by sociologist Adam Gamoran and his colleagues (1995) concluded that Oakes was partially correct in her arguments. They agreed with Oakes’s conclusions that tracking reinforces previously existing inequalities for average or poor students but countered her argument by asserting that tracking <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_628" title="628"></span>does have positive benefits for “advanced” students. The debate about the effects of tracking is sure to continue as scholars analyze more data.</p>

<section id="school-discipline">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_4">School Discipline</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the past two decades, scholars and educators have been increasingly interested in another aspect of school culture that may affect student outcomes: school discipline. Some sociologists have noted that there has been a shift in school discipline toward more punitive policies that mirror current trends in our nation’s criminal justice system. Moreover, this shift has been most acute among schools located in poor areas and attended largely by members of ethnic minority groups.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the major changes in school discipline came in 1995, when Congress amended the Gun-Free School Zones Act. This act, and subsequent federal mandates, established a “zero-tolerance” policy for weapons and drugs in schools. Zero tolerance was initially meant to address school violence by mandating suspension or expulsion for possession of drugs or weapons in school. However, as it was implemented nationwide, it was expanded to include a broad range of misbehavior. Critics of the policy argue that it has led to unnecessary police intervention in schools and has increased racial bias. For example, data from the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (2018) show that while Black students represent only 15 percent of total enrollment, they account for 31 percent of students referred to law enforcement or subjected to a school-related arrest. Activists and educators opposed to zero tolerance have coined the term <i class="italic">school-to-prison pipeline</i> as a way of emphasizing the negative impact of the policy.</p>
<figure class="figure--fullwidth" data-figure-id="ch16ph06"><a data-href="../images/Ch16ph06.jpg" tabindex="0" data-size="2597x1753"><img class="figure__image" alt="" src="../images/00241.jpeg" data-image-id="ch16ph06"/></a>
<figcaption class="figure__caption">A police officer walks a drug-sniffing dog through the halls of a school in Indianapolis. Opponents of punitive school-discipline policies claim they create a school-to-prison pipeline.</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Disciplinary practices in schools, it has been argued, also appear to be influenced by media representations and negative images of Black and Latino youth. Ann Arnett Ferguson’s ethnographic study of middle school children (2000), for example, shows how institutional discourses (such as the use of prison metaphors), the subjective views of teachers, and the treatment Black boys receive in school influence the ways in which Black boys see themselves—that is, as criminally oriented.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Other researchers have noted that punitive school-discipline policies appear to be, in part, a response to low performance in inner-city schools populated by low-income, minority students. Based on ethnographic research in an urban school, Kathleen Nolan and Jean Anyon (2004) theorize that, within our current economy, criminalizing school-discipline policies are a means to manage an economically and educationally marginalized group. They also contend that when students embrace an oppositional culture, they may no longer be <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_629" title="629"></span>participating in the reproduction of their status as manual laborers, as Paul Willis argued (1977). Instead, as misbehavior comes to be managed by the police in schools, students may be participating in the reproduction of themselves as “criminalized subjects,” or as individuals who will spend a lifetime entangled in one way or another (incarceration, parole, probation) with the criminal justice system.</p>
