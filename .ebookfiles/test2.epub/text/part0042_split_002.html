<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We often judge ourselves by how we think we appear to others, which Cooley termed the “looking-glass self.” Groups as well as individuals provide the standards by which we <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_176" title="176"></span>make self-evaluations. Robert K. Merton (1968; orig. 1938) elaborated on Cooley’s work by introducing the concept of the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-reference-group" href="part0042_split_005.html#reference-group">reference group</a>—a group that provides a standard for judging one’s attitudes or behaviors (see also Hyman and Singer, 1968). Family, peers, classmates, and coworkers are crucial reference groups. However, you don’t have to belong to a group for it to be a reference group. Regardless of his or her station in life, a person may identify with the wealth and power of Fortune 500 corporate executives, admire the contributions of Nobel Prize–winning scientists, or be captivated by the glitter of Hollywood stars. Although few of us interact socially with such reference groups, we may take pride in identifying with them, glorify their accomplishments, and even imitate the behavior of their members. This is why it is critical for children—minority children in particular, whose groups are often represented with negative stereotypes in the media—to be exposed to reference groups that model positive standards of behavior.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Reference groups may be primary (such as the family) or secondary (such as a group of soldiers). They may even be fictional. One of the chief functions of advertising is to create a set of imaginary reference groups that will influence consumers’ buying habits. For example, when cosmetic ads feature thin models with flawless complexions, the message is simple: “If you want to look as though you are part of an in-group of highly attractive, eternally youthful women, buy this product.” In reality, the models seldom have the unblemished features depicted; instead, the ideal features are constructed through artful lighting, photographic techniques, and computer enhancement. Similarly, the happy-go-lucky, physically perfect young men and women seen sailing or playing volleyball or hang gliding in beer commercials have little to do with the reality of most of our lives—or, indeed, with the lives of the actors in those commercials. The message, however, is otherwise: “Drink this beer, and you will be a member of the carefree in-group in this ad.”</p>
