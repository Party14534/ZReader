<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Social institutions are the cement of social life. They are the basic living arrangements that human beings work out with one another, by means of which continuity is achieved across the generations.</b></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">We begin in <a href="part0090_split_000.html#2LQIK0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 14</a> with work and economic life. Although the nature of work varies widely both within and across societies, work is one of the most pervasively important of all human pursuits. In <a href="part0096_split_000.html#2RHM00-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 15</a>, we look at the institutions of kinship, marriage, and the family. Although the social obligations associated with kinship vary depending on the type of society, in each, families are the context within which the young are provided with care and protection. Marriage is more or less universally connected to the family because it is a means of establishing new kin connections and forming a household in which children are brought up. In traditional cultures, much of the direct learning a child receives occurs within the family context. In modern societies, children spend many years of their lives in special places of instruction outside the familyâ€”schools and colleges. They also are constantly fed images and information from the mass media.</b></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1"><a href="part0102_split_000.html#318PC0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 16</a> looks at the ways in which formal education is organized, concentrating particularly on the relationship between education and inequality. The subject of <a href="part0108_split_000.html#36VSO0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 17</a> is religion. Although religious beliefs and practices are found in all cultures, the changes affecting religion in modern societies have been particularly acute. We analyze the nature of these changes, considering in what ways traditional types of religion still maintain their influence.</b></p>
