<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to Philip Hammond (1992), there have been three historical periods in the United States when religion has undergone <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-disestablishment" href="part0112_split_004.html#disestablishment">disestablishment</a>—that is, when the political influence of established religions has been successfully challenged. The first such disestablishment occurred with the 1791 ratification of the Bill of Rights, which calls for the separation of church and state. Some sociologists see this separation as characteristic of the industrial societies of Europe and North America, in which different institutions specialize in different functions—from economics to medicine and from education to politics. Religion is no exception (Chaves, 1993, 1994; Parsons, 1964; orig. 1951, 1960).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The second disestablishment occurred between the 1890s and the 1920s, fed by an influx of about 17 million immigrants (mainly European), many of whom were Catholic. The long-standing notion of a predominantly Protestant United States was challenged, and the mainstream Protestant churches never fully regained their influence in politics or in defining national values.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The third disestablishment occurred during the 1960s and 1970s, when the anti–Vietnam War movement, the fight for racial equality, and experimentation with alternative lifestyles eroded core religious beliefs and values. Fundamental challenges arose in areas such as sexuality, family authority, sexual and lifestyle preferences, women’s rights, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_695" title="695"></span>and birth control (Glock, 1976; Hammond, 1992; Hunter, 1987; Roof and McKinney, 1990; Wuthnow, 1976, 1978, 1990).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This disestablishment of religion challenged the political influence of religion. Did it also mean that religion was less important to individuals or that secular influences were on the rise? Even during the 1960s and 1970s, when the third disestablishment was at its peak, the religious beliefs of many Americans appeared to be stronger than ever (Roof, Carroll, and Roozen, 1995). For many people, religious beliefs became increasingly private as more people sought spiritual experiences outside of established religious organizations (Roof, 1993; Wuthnow, 1998). In fact, the third religious disestablishment arguably contributed to the growing strength of conservative religious denominations, whose adherents reacted strongly to what they perceived as the bankruptcy of liberal theology. Conservative evangelicals effectively helped shape public debate, bringing moral issues such as abortion, sexuality, and lifestyle into political discourse. While liberal theology dominated the mainline churches, conservative theology became increasingly influential in politics (Wuthnow, 1990). Beginning with the Reverend Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority in the 1970s, evangelical groups, especially those with fundamentalist values, have become increasingly involved in the Christian Right in national politics, particularly in the conservative wing of the Republican Party (Kiecolt and Nelson, 1991; Simpson, 1985; Woodrum, 1988). The Christian Right has emerged as a significant force in politics, waging what it views as the “culture wars” between liberalism and traditional religious values.</p>
