<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">STATISTICAL TERMS</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Research in sociology often makes use of statistical techniques in the analysis of findings. Some are highly sophisticated and complex, but those most often used are easy to understand. The most common are <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-measures-of-central-tendency" href="part0018_split_007.html#measures-of-central-tendency"><b class="bold1">measures of central tendency</b></a> (ways of calculating averages) and <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-correlation-coefficients" href="part0018_split_007.html#correlation-coefficients"><b class="bold1">correlation coefficients</b></a> (measures of the degree to which one variable relates consistently to another).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are three methods of calculating averages, each of which has certain advantages and shortcomings. Take as an example the amount of personal wealth (including all assets, such as houses, cars, bank accounts, and investments) owned by 13 individuals. Suppose the 13 own the following amounts:</p>
<ol class="fmnl">
<li class="bcpt" value="1">$0</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="2">$5,000</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="3">$10,000</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="4">$20,000</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="5">$40,000</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="6">$40,000</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="7">$40,000</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="8">$80,000</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="9">$100,000</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="10">$150,000</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="11">$200,000</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="12">$400,000</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="13">$10,000,000</li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-mean" href="part0018_split_007.html#mean"><b class="bold1">mean</b></a> corresponds to the average, arrived at by adding together the personal wealth of all the people and dividing the result by the number of people in the sample (13). The total is $11,085,000; dividing this amount by 13, we calculate the mean to be $852,692.31. The mean is often a useful calculation because it is based on the whole range of data provided. However, the mean can be misleading when one or a small number of cases is very different from the majority. In this example, the mean is not in fact an appropriate measure of central tendency, because the presence of one very large figure, $10,000,000, skews the picture. One might get the impression, when using the mean to summarize these data, that most of the people own far more than they actually do.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In such instances, one of two other measures may be used. The <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-mode" href="part0018_split_007.html#mode"><b class="bold1">mode</b></a> is the figure that occurs most frequently in a given set of data. In our example, it is $40,000. The problem with the mode is that it doesn’t take into account the overall distribution of the data—that is, the range of figures covered. The most frequently occurring case in a set of figures is not necessarily representative of the distribution as a whole and thus may not be a useful average. In this example, $40,000 is too close to the lower end of the figures.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The third measure is the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-median" href="part0018_split_007.html#median"><b class="bold1">median</b></a>, which is the middle of any set of figures; here, this would be the seventh figure, again, $40,000. Our sample includes an odd number of figures, 13. If there were an even number—for instance, 12—the median would be calculated by taking the mean of the two middle cases, figures 6 and 7. As with the mode, the median gives no indication of the actual range of the data being measured.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sometimes a researcher will use more than one measure of central tendency to avoid giving a deceptive picture of the average. More often, a researcher will calculate the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-standard-deviation" href="part0018_split_007.html#standard-deviation"><b class="bold1">standard deviation</b></a> for the data in question. This is a way of calculating the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-degree-of-dispersal" href="part0018_split_007.html#degree-of-dispersal"><b class="bold1">degree of dispersal</b></a>, or the range, of a set of figures—which in this case goes from $0 to $10,000,000.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Correlation coefficients offer a useful way of expressing how closely connected two (or more) variables are. When two variables correlate completely, we can speak of a perfect positive correlation, expressed as 1.0. When no relation is found between two variables—they have no consistent connection at all—the coefficient is 0.0. A perfect negative correlation, expressed as ‒1.0, exists when two variables are in a completely inverse relation to one another. Perfect correlations are never found in the social sciences. Correlations of the order of 0.6 or more, whether positive or negative, are usually regarded as indicating a strong degree of connection between whatever variables are being analyzed. Positive correlations on this level might be found between, say, social class background and voting behavior.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A classic example is the 1971 experiment carried out by Philip Zimbardo (1992), who set up a make-believe jail, randomly assigning some student volunteers to the role of guard and other volunteers to the role of prisoner. His aim was to see how role-playing would affect changes in attitude and behavior. The results shocked the investigators. Students who played guards quickly assumed an authoritarian manner; they displayed real hostility toward the prisoners, verbally abusing and bullying them. The prisoners, by contrast, showed a mixture of apathy and rebelliousness—a response often noted among inmates in actual prisons. These effects were so marked and the level of tension so high that the experiment had to be called off at an early stage. The results, however, were important: Zimbardo concluded that behavior in prisons is more influenced by the nature of the prison situation than by the individual characteristics of those involved.</p>
<section id="advantages-and-disadvantages-of-experiments">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Advantages and Disadvantages of Experiments</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The advantage of experimental studies is that researchers can test a hypothesis under highly controlled conditions established by the researcher. The ability to control experimental conditions, however, is also the principal weakness of experimental studies, which in many ways are artificial. To the extent that the laboratory fails to duplicate a natural setting, it is difficult to generalize the results of laboratory experiments to the larger society. We can bring only small groups of individuals into a laboratory setting, and, in such experiments, people know they are being studied and may behave unnaturally. As a result, sociologists sometimes use field experiments, in which a real-life situation is simulated as accurately as possible.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">A Recent Example of an Experiment</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 1994, a group of sociologists launched an experiment to find out if it makes a difference to move people from high-poverty ghetto neighborhoods to low-poverty neighborhoods. People who responded to an advertisement offering vouchers for new apartments were randomly assigned to two groups—those who were given the opportunity to move (experimental group) and those who weren’t (control group).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Why did the experimenters compare the fates of two groups who both applied for vouchers, one of which got them and one of which didn’t? Why not compare people who got the vouchers against those who did not apply in the first place? In fact, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_46" title="46"></span>study kept data on all three groups. The ones who applied but did not receive vouchers had more in common with the ones who got to move, because they also wanted to escape from their current circumstances. The best comparison is between two groups that wanted to move. They are alike in all characteristics except for whether they actually stayed in place or experienced a new living condition.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Following the groups since the mid-1990s, researchers made some important discoveries. For example, people who moved did not do much better in the labor market than those who stayed behind. But the movers tended to be much happier, and they experienced decreased levels of obesity when compared with those who did not get to move.</p>
