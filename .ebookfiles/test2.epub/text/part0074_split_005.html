<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In today’s age of globalization and rapid social change, the rich benefits and complex challenges of ethnic diversity are confronting a growing number of states. As international migration accelerates along with the global economy, the mixing of populations will intensify. Meanwhile, ethnic tensions and conflicts continue, threatening the existence of some multiethnic states and hinting at protracted violence in others. How can ethnic diversity be accommodated and ethnic conflict be averted? Within <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_398" title="398"></span>multiethnic societies, what should be the relationship between ethnic minority groups and the majority population? Four primary models of ethnic integration address these challenges: assimilation, the “melting pot,” pluralism, and multiculturalism. These will be discussed shortly.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For many years, the two most common positive models of political ethnic harmony in the United States were those of assimilation and the melting pot. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-assimilation" href="part0074_split_007.html#assimilation">Assimilation</a> meant that new immigrant groups would assume the attitudes and language of the dominant White community. The idea of the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-melting-pot" href="part0074_split_007.html#melting-pot">melting pot</a> was different and involved merging different cultures and outlooks by stirring them all together. A newer model of ethnic relations is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-pluralism" href="part0074_split_007.html#pluralism">pluralism</a>, in which ethnic cultures exist separately yet participate in the larger society’s economic and political life. A recent outgrowth of pluralism is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-multiculturalism" href="part0074_split_007.html#multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a>, in which ethnic groups exist separately and equally. It seems possible to create a society in which ethnic groups are separate and equal, as in Switzerland, where French, German, and Italian groups coexist in the same society. But this situation is unusual, and it is unlikely that the United States will mirror this achievement in the near future.</p>
