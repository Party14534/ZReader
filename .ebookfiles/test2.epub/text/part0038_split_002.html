<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">How did you meet your last romantic partner? Perhaps you met at a party or sat next to each other in your introduction to sociology course. Can you remember what it was that drew you to him or her? Was there something subtle or unexpected that signaled to you there might be an attraction, like a tone of voice, a wink, or light touch to the shoulder? Or did you already have a clear-cut notion of the kind of person you wanted to date—maybe someone tall, or who shared your religious background, or who had professional goals similar to your own—and you carefully surveyed those whom you saw as an “appropriate” partner, before making your move?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While popular music suggests that two strangers will lock eyes across a crowded room and true love will follow, in our current digital age, meetings often happen in a far less romantic and more strategic way. According to a recent survey of more than 2,000 Americans 18 years of age or older, 15 percent of adults have used a mobile dating app or website (Smith, 2016). Dozens of smartphone apps like Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, Adventurely, and Happn allow people to search through endless photos of eligible partners and screen them, or “swipe right,” based on personal preferences like education, occupation, age, height, body weight, gender, sexual orientation, and race. Usage is particularly high among young adults: More than a quarter (27 percent) of 18- to 24-year-olds have used a mobile dating app or website. Two-thirds of those who meet potential partners online have gone out on a date.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although apps may take the romance and intrigue out of dating, they do fulfill a practical function. Young people can shop for a date in exactly the same way they would shop for a new car; they can specify precisely what they want and search for potential partners who possess those traits. From a sociological perspective, many apps provide strong evidence that norms of “homogamy,” or dating and marrying a partner similar to oneself, are still pervasive in U.S. society. New studies also show that apps provide evidence of “hypergamy,” or the preference for women, typically, to partner with a man with richer socioeconomic resources than her own.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For instance, sociologist Kevin Lewis (2013) analyzed data from more than 126,000 dating site users and found that users tended to show the greatest interest in those of their same ethnic background. He analyzed only the first message sent and first reply of each user. He found the strongest tendency to initiate contact within one’s own race among East and South Asians and Indians and weakest among Whites. He found that while users would respond to a message from someone from a different ethnic or racial group, this open-mindedness was relatively short-lived; most would promptly return to their old patterns of communicating only with members of their own group.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Lewis’s analyses also uncovered evidence that users hold dating preferences consistent with “highly gendered status hierarchies.” For instance, women tend to seek out men with more education and more income than they themselves have. Although men also sought educated partners, they tended to show greatest interest in women with a college education—“no more and no less.” Racial hierarchies also emerged. White men, Lewis found, enjoyed a privileged position, receiving the most initial messages, while Black women received the fewest.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Additionally, more than a quarter of online daters report having been contacted in a way that made them feel harassed or uncomfortable. Not surprisingly, perhaps, a significant gender difference exists here: 42 percent of women complained about this type of contact, compared with 17 percent of men (Pew Research Center, 2013b). It turns out that online dating interactions tend to be gendered as well. One study of nearly 15,000 men and women found that men are far more likely to initiate online exchanges than are women, an unfortunate asymmetry because</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">women who initiate conversations have greater odds of success with equally desirable partners than women who wait to be messaged, but women are much less likely to seize the initiator advantage. In other words, by relying on men to initiate a relationship, women often forego the promise of online dating and are left wondering where all the good men have gone. (Kreager et al., 2014)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The authors conclude that rather than placing men and women on an equal footing when it comes to establishing intimate partnerships, online dating actually reproduces gender inequality. Whether in a crowded bar or sheltered by the initial privacy of their mobile phones, women are less likely to make the first move, and this reluctance works to their disadvantage. The study’s message to women is clear: Don’t be shy. As the study notes, “Women should not be discouraged from sending messages if they want to contact attractive partners” (Kreager et al., 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It remains unclear whether online dating is preferable to meeting the old-fashioned way. On the plus side, it provides access to a large number of potential partners in an initially anonymous setting, which may be of special benefit for those too shy or introverted to initiate direct face-to-face contact. The use of online questionnaires, which permit would-be partners to determine whether they are compatible before they ever <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_160" title="160"></span>meet, ideally provides a relatively safe way to winnow out poor choices. Yet the very anonymity of online dating invites deception, ranging from the unintentional (are most people accurate judges of their best personality traits?) to outright deception (lying about one’s age, physical characteristics, or even marital status). One study concludes:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Deliberate deception is unlikely, however, to account for the entire difference between online and offline impression formation. Even when deception is not an issue, face-to-face interaction still conveys information that cannot be gleaned readily from CMC [Computer Mediated Communication]. In particular, CMC is unlikely to convey experiential attributes as effectively as face-to-face interactions. (Finkel et al., 2012)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Online dating may be efficient, easy, and increasingly common, but it has yet to prove that it’s preferable to locking eyes across a crowded room.</p>
