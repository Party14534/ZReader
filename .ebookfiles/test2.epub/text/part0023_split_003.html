<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Material culture consists of the physical objects that a society creates that influence the ways in which people live. These include consumer goods, from clothes to cars to houses; the tools and technologies used to make those goods, from sewing machines to computerized factories; and the towns and cities that serve as places for people to live and work. A central aspect of a society’s material culture is technology.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, material culture is rapidly becoming globalized, largely through modern information technology such as the computer and the Internet. Although the United States has been in the forefront of this technological revolution, most other industrial countries are catching up. In fact, it no longer makes sense to speak of an exclusively “U.S. technology” any more than it makes sense to speak of a U.S. car. The iPhone, for example, contains hundreds of components that are sourced from some 200 manufacturers across the planet, embodying technology developed in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Europe, and the United States (Minasians, 2016). Another example of the globalization of material culture is the way that classrooms and department stores the world over increasingly resemble one another, and the fact that McDonald’s restaurants are now found on nearly every continent.</p>
