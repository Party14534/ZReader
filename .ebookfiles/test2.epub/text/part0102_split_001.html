<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The correct answer is <i class="italic">d</i>, because the criteria for admission to universities have changed over time. In the early twentieth century, college admissions began to undergo a series of major transformations, for reasons that were kept discreetly out of the public eye (Karabel, 2005; Gladwell, 2005). In 1905, the SAT was instituted, and for the first time, people started getting into college on the basis of standardized tests. Within a few years, the Harvard class had become 15 percent Jewish, as Jews (not unlike Asians today) excelled at the standardized test in disproportionate numbers. Sociologists to this day disagree about whether this success can be explained by cultural characteristics or economic advantages that even some relatively poor ethnic and religious minorities experience in comparison with many other minority groups that don’t do as well.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Nevertheless, reflecting the wider anti-Semitism of the era, the people who were running Harvard looked at this outcome as a very undesirable turn of events. The administrators drew an analogy between the university and hotels in upstate New York—first the Jews would arrive, then the Gentiles would leave, and then the Jews would leave and nobody would be left or want to attend the school anymore (Zimmerman, 2010). So, Harvard determined that it needed to find another way of conducting admissions. Rather than putting quotas on Jews, they decided to change to a system of admissions very much like the one we know today. They would start to look at “the whole person,” rather than give advantages to people simply because they’d done well on a standardized test. In recent years, these institutions have generally transitioned to looking for “best graduates” rather than “best students”; that is, not students who will excel academically in college, but instead, those who will become successful after college (Gladwell, 2005). Excellent high school students compete for a limited number of spots at elite American colleges, with many able candidates being rejected in favor of athletes or student leaders in lower academic standing.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, it seems natural that a college would want to get to know a student as a whole person. In your college application, you had to write an essay that helped define you as a total human being. You may have tried to show what an interesting person you are by discussing the clubs you were a part of and the sports you participated in. While answer <i class="italic">c</i> is not entirely correct, athletes may experience an advantage in admissions over their peers, even when their GPAs and SAT scores are lower, particularly when they are seen as contributing to the college’s extramural sports programs (in many universities, competitive sports teams can produce significant revenues). When Ivy League schools switched to the new system, they would also send representatives to various schools around the country to interview prospective students. They didn’t want too many “nerds.” They wanted well-rounded, good-looking people—future leaders who would have an impact on the country and who would make these schools look good in return. And so they would conduct interviews and keep notes on whether an applicant was tall, handsome, or pretty (by whatever standard that was determined).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There were things the admissions office simply didn’t like: people with big ears, for example. Short people were also undesirable, as recommendation files from that time indicate. In the mid-1950s, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale were actually keeping records on the number of men who entered the freshman class who were over six feet tall. Today, all schools release records about their incoming freshman classes, but they are more likely to keep track of race, class, and gender variables than height or ear size. Thus, answer choice <i class="italic">a</i> is incorrect if we are considering the present day; though physical appearance was at one time a salient aspect of college admissions criteria, it is generally no longer a consideration. Moreover, even the use of SATs is now being reconsidered by many colleges and universities, since there is evidence that performance on such tests is closely linked to family income, education, and race, as discussed below. Some 50 accredited higher education institutions announced in 2018 and 2019 that they were dropping SAT requirements, bringing the total to more than a thousand, including more than half of the highest-rated colleges in US News &amp; World Report, and resulting in greater student body diversity (Strauss, 2019). All in all, the trend at universities has been toward creating a level playing field for applicants of all income levels, races, and educational background and thus reducing inequalities in society at large.</p>
