<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Identity</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The cultural settings in which we grow up influence our behavior, but that does not mean that humans lack individuality or free will. The fact that from birth to death we are involved in interaction with others certainly conditions our personalities, values, and behavior. Yet socialization is also at the origin of our individuality and freedom. In the course of socialization, each of us develops a sense of identity and the capacity for independent thought and action.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The concept of identity in sociology is multifaceted. Broadly speaking, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-identity" href="part0029_split_005.html#identity">identity</a> relates to people’s understandings about who they are and what is meaningful to them. These understandings are formed in relation to certain attributes that take priority over other sources of meaning. Some of the main sources of identity are gender, sexual orientation, nationality, ethnicity, and social class. Sociologists often speak of two types of identity: social identity and self-identity (or personal identity). These types are analytically distinct but closely related to each other.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-identity" href="part0029_split_005.html#social-identity">Social identity</a> refers to the characteristics that other people attribute to an individual—markers that indicate who, in a basic sense, that individual is. At the same time, these characteristics place that individual in relation to others who share the same attributes. Examples of social identities are student, parent, lawyer, Muslim, homeless, Asian, dyslexic, and married. All individuals have more than one social identity, reflecting the many dimensions of their lives. A person <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_109" title="109"></span>could simultaneously be a parent, an engineer, a Catholic, and a city council member. This plurality of social identities can be a source of conflict.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most individuals organize meaning and experience in their lives around a primary identity that is continuous across time and place. Sometimes people organize their lives around the identity that is most <i class="italic">salient</i> or personally meaningful and important. For instance, if being a devout follower of one’s faith is very salient to an individual, they may eat particular foods, wear certain types of clothing, choose to socialize largely with fellow members of the community, and hold beliefs consistent with their religious teachings (Stryker and Serpe, 1994).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologist Everett Hughes noted that some identities can overpower all the other traits an individual possesses; these identities are referred to as <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-master-status" href="part0029_split_005.html#master-status">master statuses</a>. Race, sex, age, and visible body features are among the most common master statuses. For instance, people who are morbidly obese may find that many of their interactions and behaviors are tied to their large bodies, in part because the social structure is organized in such a way as to remind them constantly of their weight; these reminders include such things as narrow airplane or movie theater seats, lack of clothing options, and disapproving looks and comments by others. A person who happens to weigh 300 pounds might also be a parent, a schoolteacher, a best friend, and a computer whiz, yet others who interact with the individual may only see the weight and may treat them accordingly.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Social identities involve a collective dimension. They mark ways that individuals are the same as others. Shared identities—predicated on common goals, values, or experiences—aside from forming an important base for social movements, serve as a powerful source of personal meaning or self-worth.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">If social identities mark ways in which individuals are the same as others, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-self-identity" href="part0029_split_005.html#self-identity">self-identity</a> (or personal identity) sets us apart as distinct individuals. Self-identity refers to the process of self-development through which we formulate a unique sense of ourselves and our relationship to the world. The notion of self-identity draws heavily on the work of symbolic interactionists. Our constant negotiation with the outside world shapes our sense of self, linking our own personal and public worlds. Though the cultural and social environment is a factor in shaping self-identity, individual agency and choice are key.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Tracing the changes in self-identity from traditional to modern societies, we can see a shift away from the fixed, inherited factors that previously guided identity formation, such as membership in social groups bound by social class or ethnicity. People’s identities are now more multifaceted and less stable, owing to urban growth, industrialization, and the breakdown of earlier social formations. Individuals have become more socially and geographically mobile. Freed from the homogeneous communities of the past, people now find that other sources of personal meaning, such as gender identity, sexual orientation, or political beliefs play a greater role in their sense of identity.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today we have unprecedented opportunities to create our own identities. We are our own best resources in defining who we are, where we have come from, and where we are going. Now that the traditional signposts of identity have become less essential, the social world confronts us with a dizzying array of choices about who to be, how to live, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_110" title="110"></span>and what to do, without offering much guidance about which selections to make. The decisions we make in our everyday lives—about what to wear, how to behave, and how to spend our time—help make us who we are. Through our capacity as self-conscious, self-aware human beings, we constantly create and re-create our identities.</p>
