<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the major changes in U.S. population distribution in the period since World War II is the movement of large parts of city populations to urban areas, both large cities and newly constructed suburbs. At the same time, rural populations have continued to decline as young people seek richer professional and personal opportunities in our nation’s large and small cities. We therefore begin with a discussion of rural America and suburbia before moving on to look at larger metropolitan areas.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">The Decline of Rural America?</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Rural areas of the United States are defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census residually, as all those places located outside of urban areas. They typically have fewer than 2,500 people and are often areas where people live in open country. In the 1950s, rural areas accounted for more than a third (36 percent) of the U.S. population; as of the most recent Census (2010), that figure has declined to less than a fourth (19 percent), even though rural America contains most of the country’s land mass (97 percent), (Ratcliffe et al., 2016; America Counts, 2017). Population decline in rural areas is the result of many factors: the mechanization of agriculture, which replaced more labor-intensive small family farms with large mechanized industrial farms; lack of economic opportunities, reflected in high rates of poverty; the attraction of urban lifestyles for younger people; and, in some regions, a dearth of natural amenities such as forests, lakes, or temperate winters. The outmigration of young people in particular has meant that fewer babies are born to replace the aging rural population (Johnson, 2006). As a result, many rural areas have disproportionately high numbers of older adults, a phenomenon called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-aging-in-place" href="part0124_split_006.html#aging-in-place">aging in place</a> that explains the relatively old populations in rural areas in the “Rust Belt” (the area around the Great Lakes and upper Midwest that has lost industry) (McGranahan and Beale, 2002).</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One out of every four rural children lives in poverty, higher than the urban rate (one out of every five) (NLIHC, 2015). According to one report, of the 50 U.S. counties <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_783" title="783"></span>with the highest rates of poverty, 48 are rural (<i class="italic">The Atlantic</i>, 2016). Race also shapes rural poverty, just as it shapes urban poverty. Rural counties with the highest child-poverty rates often have majority non-White populations. These areas include Black-majority counties in the Mississippi Delta and counties in the Midwest and West that have large Native American populations, often dwelling on Indian reservations (O’Hare and Mather, 2008).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">High rates of poverty in rural areas are associated with a host of other social problems. A large body of research has found that people who live in rural areas are beset with numerous health-related issues, such as disease and disability, obesity, injury, and chronic pain (Monnat and Beeler Pickett, 2011; Schiller et al., 2012). Partly as a result, life expectancies are shorter (Singh and Siahpush, 2014); rates of alcohol- and drug-related mortality and suicide are higher (Hedegaard et al., 2018). Opioid addiction and abuse, a growing problem throughout the United States, were once thought to be especially prevalent in rural areas, although the most detailed study to date found that opioid-related deaths among non-Hispanic Whites were actually highest in large metropolitan counties, partly because opioids were more readily available there. While opioid deaths varied across rural counties, some of the highest rates in all U.S. counties were found in rural counties where mines had closed or other jobs were lost. The economic distress of those who remained behind, often coupled with family breakdown, went hand-in-hand with psychological distress; anxiety, despair, and hopelessness resulted in alcohol abuse, drug addiction, and suicide. It is important to emphasize that all rural life is not bleak; there are enormous variations between rural areas (Monnat, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One indication that many rural areas still have strong appeal is that the decline in rural population appears to have leveled off in 2011–2012 and has since begun a slight uptick (USDA, 2018). And some of the most rapidly growing counties in the United States are rural: North Dakota’s Williams County, for example, was the fastest-growing county in the United States between 2010 and 2018. Its 22,400 people grew to 35,350 (a three-fifths increase), driven in part by oil and agriculture (US Census, 2019f; Williams County, 2019). The economic recovery of the past decade may be part of the reason, although some surveys show that many Americans would prefer to live in rural areas rather than large cities, if they had a choice. A recent poll (Gallup, 2018), for example, found that more than a quarter of all respondents (27 percent) said they would choose a rural area. The preference for rural living, however, was strongest (31 percent) among respondents over 50; respondents 18–29 overwhelmingly chose big cities (17 percent) and their suburbs (28 percent). While city lights still hold their allure for younger people, this may change, as information technology increasingly provides the flexibility to work at home, even when that home is distant from the office.</p>

<section id="suburbanization-section">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Suburbanization</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the United States, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-suburbanization" href="part0124_split_006.html#suburbanization">suburbanization</a>—the massive development and inhabiting of towns surrounding a city—rapidly increased during the 1950s and 1960s, a time of great economic growth. During the postwar decade, the population in cities increased by 10 percent, whereas in the suburban areas, it grew by nearly half. A series of federal <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_784" title="784"></span>policies after World War II encouraged Americans to pursue the “American dream”: owning a house and a piece of land. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provided assistance in obtaining mortgage loans, making it possible in the early postwar period for families to buy housing in the suburbs for less than they would have paid for rent in the cities. The FHA did not offer financial assistance to improve older homes or to build new homes in the central areas of ethnically mixed cities; its large-scale aid went only to the builders and buyers of suburban housing. The FHA, together with the Veterans Administration, which provided assistance to returning soldiers, funded almost half of all suburban housing built during the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">President Eisenhower oversaw the passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act in 1956, authorizing $32 billion ($300 billion in today’s dollars) to be used for building the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. Gasoline taxes were also used to fund the emerging interstate highway system, which launched today’s network of freeways and toll roads. The interstate highway system both resulted from—and contributed to—the expansion of the automobile industry, as the two-car family became common. High-speed highways and the rapidly growing number of cars that came to rely on them provided a boost in the postwar economy. At the same time, they enabled families to move to lower-tax, less expensive suburbs, and drive to work in neighboring cities. As industries and services followed people to the suburbs, commuting between suburbs also became common. Suburbs eventually became more racially and ethnically diverse; by 2010, minorities had come to comprise 35 percent of all suburban residents—close to their proportion of the overall U.S. population—although the fastest-growing, low-density, distant suburbs (so-called “exurbs”) remained largely White (Brookings Institution, 2011). Members of minority groups move to the suburbs for reasons similar to those who preceded them: better housing, schools, and amenities. Like the people who began the exodus to suburbia in the 1950s, they are mostly middle-class professionals.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, scholars debate whether the divide between “suburb” and “city” is meaningful, as many older suburbs, often on the fringes of major cities, share many characteristics that were once hallmarks of city life—pockets of poverty, an aging housing stock (occupied by aging residents), old infrastructure, growing immigrant populations, and little land left for new development that will generate property-tax revenue. These inner suburbs stand in stark contrast to outer suburbs that have new housing stock, expanses of open land, and populations that tend to be more racially and ethnically homogeneous. As a result, researchers increasingly use the terms <i class="italic">urban area</i> or <i class="italic">metropolitan area</i> to describe regions that encompass central cities and their immediate outskirts. Between 2010 and 2018, metropolitan areas—encompassing center cities and their surrounding suburbs—grew by 19 million people (7.1 percent). Roughly 86 percent of the U.S. population now lives in metropolitan areas (some 281 million people) (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2019f).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While the last several decades saw a movement from the cities to the suburbs, they also witnessed a shift in the regional distribution of the U.S. population from north to south and east to west. Between 2010 and 2018, regional growth was much more rapid in the South (8.6 percent) and West (8.2 percent) than in the Northeast (1.3 percent) and Midwest (2.0 percent). Overall, the South and West accounted for 88.4 percent of the total U.S. population growth between 2000 and 2010 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2019i).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Urban Problems: Gentrification, Urban Renewal, and Racial Segregation</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Beginning in the 1950s, many major U.S. cities—particularly in the Northwest and Midwest—began losing businesses, jobs, and middle-class residents, who fled to the suburbs. Millions of blue-collar jobs disappeared, which particularly affected the poorly educated, who were drawn mostly from minority groups. By the 1990s, an urban underclass had emerged, partly as the result of an economic transformation that was replacing manufacturing jobs with information economy jobs requiring new skills, or low-wage service sector employment (Kasarda, 1993). William Julius Wilson (1991, 1996) has argued that the problems of the urban underclass grew out of this economic transformation (see <a href="part0053_split_000.html#1IHDQ0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 8</a>).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">More recently, there has been a revival of many central cities, as wealthier professionals in some regions have moved back into downtown areas. This revival has resulted in a process of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-gentrification" href="part0124_split_006.html#gentrification">gentrification</a> whereby older, deteriorated housing and other buildings are renovated as more affluent groups move into an area. Such a renewal process is called <i class="italic">gentrification</i> because those areas or buildings become upgraded and return to the control of the urban “gentry”—high-income dwellers—rather than remain in the hands of the poor. Gentrification sometimes results from market forces, as when wealthier newcomers buy up cheap, run-down properties and fix them up, resulting in neighborhood changes that attract other affluent buyers, in a cycle that eventually drives up housing prices and rents, forcing out the poor who can no longer afford housing costs. Gentrification is nothing new—30 years ago sociologist Elijah Anderson (1990) analyzed the effect of gentrification in a Philadelphia neighborhood. He found that many Black residences were condemned, forcing more than a thousand <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_786" title="786"></span>people to leave in search of more affordable neighborhoods. The White newcomers had come in search of cheap “antique” housing, closer access to their city-based jobs, and a trendy urban lifestyle. Over time, the neighborhood was gradually transformed into a White middle-class enclave.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Often gentrification results not purely from market forces but is the result of government policies that put public funds into poor areas. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-urban-renewal" href="part0124_split_006.html#urban-renewal">Urban renewal <span>(sometimes called</span> urban redevelopment</a>) is the process of renovating deteriorating neighborhoods by using public funds to renew old buildings and construct new ones, often through large-scale demolition of slum housing. While the twin processes of gentrification and urban renewal are not new, they gained force after World War II, in large part when the 1949 and 1954 Federal Housing Acts pumped billions of federal dollars into urban renewal programs in run-down urban areas, leading Black novelist James Baldwin to describe urban renewal as “Negro removal.” The Federal Highway-Aid Act resulted in another form of slum clearance, since it enabled federal and state governments to build expressways through urban areas that were almost always occupied by low-income African Americans. Gentrification and urban renewal may have made downtown areas more desirable for affluent professionals, but they have driven out those who are unable to afford the higher housing costs, including many middle-class households. Areas that were especially hard-hit included several major urban areas in California: San Francisco/Oakland/San Jose (home to Silicon Valley), Orange County, and San Diego (Uh, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These economic changes and public policies also contributed to increased residential segregation of different racial and ethnic groups and social classes, as we saw in <a href="part0071_split_000.html#23MNU0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 11</a>. Discriminatory practices by home sellers, real estate agents, and mortgage lending institutions further added to this pattern of segregation. One-quarter of the roughly 29 million African Americans living in the largest metropolitan areas are found in segregated neighborhoods, defined as neighborhoods where more than four out of every five residents are Black (24/7 Wall St., 2016). How can this be the case, when racial segregation was outlawed more than a half century ago by the 1968 Fair Housing Act?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While some may argue that this is because most people prefer to live in racially homogeneous neighborhoods populated by people similar to themselves, it turns out that racial segregation today is in large part the result of government housing policies that began during the Great Depression of the 1930s and continued for several decades after World War II. Richard Rothstein (2017) argues that housing built under the federal Public Works Administration was deliberately segregated, with most going to Whites. After World War II, the 1949 Housing Act provided Federal Housing Administration (FHA) guarantees for bank loans, enabling the construction of large-scale White-only housing developments, with deeds that prohibited resale to African Americans (so-called restrictive covenants). At the local level, African American neighborhoods were frequently rezoned to allow industrial (and often toxic) uses, effectively turning them into slums. These and other government policies enabled White working-class Americans to buy homes in decent neighborhoods at affordable prices, while consigning <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_787" title="787"></span>most African Americans to rental housing in substandard areas.</p>
<figure class="figure--fullwidth" data-figure-id="ch19ph06"><a data-href="../images/Ch19ph06.jpg" tabindex="0" data-size="2700x1984"><img class="figure__image" alt="" src="../images/00299.jpeg" data-image-id="ch19ph06"/></a>
<figcaption class="figure__caption">For his Pulitzer Prize–winning ethnography <i class="italic">Evicted: Power and Profit in the American City,</i> sociologist Matthew Desmond conducted participant observation research of the private housing market, illuminating the often exploitative relationship between landlords and their poor tenants.</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Over many decades, home ownership became the principal source of wealth for White Americans as their homes appreciated in value over time. Rothstein argues that this historical race-based denial of equal home-ownership opportunities resulted in an enormous racial wealth gap that persists today. While Black income is currently around 60 percent of White income, Black wealth is only 5 percent to 7 percent of White wealth, making it more difficult for Blacks to buy homes at today’s prices or afford to send their children to college. These challenges are especially severe for low-income (and disproportionately minority) households, since there is an acute shortage of affordable rental units (NLIHC, 2017). Moreover, the landlord-tenant relationship is often exploitative: In the absence of rent and eviction controls, landlords will charge whatever the market will bear, and can legally evict tenants for any (or no) reason—for example, to find tenants who can afford significant rent increases. Frequent evictions, requiring moves to new neighborhoods, can serve to undermine long-term relations in low-income communities. The ties among the urban poor become weaker; the social ties that contribute to a health community become what sociologist Matthew Desmond (2016) has termed “disposable.” Evictions can be highly destructive of individuals and communities; Desmond’s work points to the central importance of affordable housing programs in a broad range of antipoverty policies.</p>

<section id="the-ghetto-as-a-social-and-historical-problem">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_4">The Ghetto as a Social and Historical Problem</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many Americans mistakenly believe that <i class="italic">ghetto</i> means a place where African Americans or Latinos live, but the word originated in sixteenth-century Italy and applied to areas of Rome and Venice where Jews were forced to live by official decree, as a way of isolating them from mainstream Christian society.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists originally drew a distinction between ghettos on the one hand and slums on the other. Ghettos were residential zones where particular groups were forced to live, not necessarily because they were poor, but because they belonged to a particular ethnic or racial group viewed as inferior and therefore in need of being forcibly cordoned off by the wider society. Slums, on the other hand, were zones inhabited by poor people who couldn’t afford to live elsewhere, including members of a dominant, nonstigmatized group, such as poor Whites in the United States. In recent years, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_788" title="788"></span>many sociologists have started using the terms <i class="italic">ghetto</i> and <i class="italic">slum</i> interchangeably, but it is better to retain the analytical clarity inherent in the former distinction.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A crucial criterion for the definition of the ghetto is that the people who live there must have been forced to do so. Indeed, this was the situation of Blacks in the United States and Jews in Rome. In the United States, Blacks were forced to live in certain parts of the northern cities because of restrictive covenants that made it illegal to sell them land in particular neighborhoods. Jews were forced to live in ghettos because of decrees by the popes. During the fourteenth century, most Jews were also forced to wear insignias when they traveled outside the zones where they lived, to indicate that they were Jews.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Whereas the inhabitants of the original ghettos were given little choice of where they could live, inhabitants of today’s ghettos may feel that they live in their highly segregated and impoverished neighborhoods by choice. Sociological studies have demonstrated over and again that when poor people have an opportunity to move, they will often resist every chance to do so. This is not because they do not want to improve their life chances, but because they do not believe their lives would be better independent of the social networks and neighborhood institutions that sustain them, even in their poor and segregated neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Are ghettos necessarily zones for the economically marginalized and exploited populations of stigmatized people? Whereas the U.S. ghetto was used to warehouse a significant labor supply for growing factories during the two world wars, the Jewish ghetto of Venice did not originally seem to have such a mission. Jews were very successful, and they continued to have significant economic ties to the wider society long after they were ghettoized (Stow, 2000). Ultimately, laws were enacted that made it difficult for Jews to carry on their occupations, but these were not intrinsic to ghettoization.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There have been many ghettos in the history of the world, but there are no sociological studies that compare ghettos in more than a few societies. For this reason, there is still much to know about the characteristics that would define the ghetto concept. From what we know, a ghetto is a residential zone in which stigmatized racial or religious groups are compelled to live by the wider society.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This takes us to an example in the contemporary United States. When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Louisiana, in August 2005, the victims of the floods that ravaged the city in the storm’s aftermath were mainly poor Blacks who lived in the most impoverished ghettos of the city. Why were these poor people disproportionately affected by the extreme weather conditions? The answer has mainly to do with the social and political history of these particular residential zones, which were always given fewer resources for drainage and pumping systems after past storms. It also has to do with the limited resources that poor people have to evacuate and the limited networks they have outside the zones where they live. By contrast with the poor Blacks who were trapped inside the ghettos as they flooded, many middle-class Whites had the resources and social connections to leave the city when warnings first appeared on the national news. The effect of Hurricane Katrina followed the fault lines of the larger urban problems that are associated with racial segregation and ghettoization in the inner cities today.</p>
