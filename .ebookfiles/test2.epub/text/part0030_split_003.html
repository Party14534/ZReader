<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Jean Piaget and the Stages of Cognitive Development</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Piaget emphasized the child’s active capability to make sense of the world. Children do not passively soak up information, but instead, select and interpret what they see, hear, and feel. Piaget described distinct stages of cognitive development during which children learn to think about themselves and their environment. Each stage involves the acquisition of new skills and depends on the successful completion of the preceding ones.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Piaget called the first stage, from birth up to about age two, the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-sensorimotor-stage" href="part0030_split_007.html#sensorimotor-stage">sensorimotor stage</a>. At this stage, infants learn mainly by touching objects, manipulating them, and physically exploring their environment. Until they are about four months of age, infants cannot differentiate themselves from their environment. For example, a child will not realize that his or her own movements cause the sides of the crib to rattle. Objects are not differentiated from persons, and the infant is unaware that anything exists outside his or her range of vision. The infant gradually learns to <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_117" title="117"></span>distinguish people from objects, realizing that both have an existence independent of his or her immediate perception of them. The main accomplishment of this stage is children’s understanding that their environment has distinct and stable properties.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The next phase, the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-preoperational-stage" href="part0030_split_007.html#preoperational-stage">preoperational stage</a>, is the one to which Piaget devoted the bulk of his research. During this stage, which lasts from age two to age seven, children master language and use words to represent objects and images in a symbolic fashion. A four-year-old might use a sweeping hand, for example, to represent the concept airplane. Piaget termed the stage “preoperational” because children are not yet able to use their developing mental capabilities systematically. Children in this stage are <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-egocentric" href="part0030_split_007.html#egocentric">egocentric</a> in the sense that they interpret the world exclusively in terms of their own position. The child does not understand, for instance, that others see objects from a different perspective. Holding a book upright, the child may ask about a picture in it, not realizing that the person sitting opposite can see only the back of the book.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Children at the preoperational stage are not able to hold connected conversations with another person. With egocentric speech, what each child says is more or less unrelated to what the other speaker has said. Children talk together but not to one another in the same sense as adults. During this stage, children have no general understanding of categories of thought that adults take for granted: concepts such as causality, speed, weight, or number. Even if the child sees water poured from a tall, thin container into a shorter, wider one, he or she will not understand that the volume of water remains the same—and the child will conclude that there is less water because the water level is lower.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A third period, the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-concrete-operational-stage" href="part0030_split_007.html#concrete-operational-stage">concrete operational stage</a>, lasts from age 7 to age 11. During this phase, children master abstract, logical notions such as causality. A child at this stage of development will recognize the false reasoning involved in the idea that the wide container holds less water than the narrow one, even though the water levels are different. The child becomes capable of carrying out the mathematical operations of multiplying, dividing, and subtracting. Children by this stage are much less egocentric. In the preoperational stage, if a girl is asked, “How many sisters do you have?” she may correctly answer, “One.” But if asked, “How many sisters does your sister have?” she will probably answer, “None,” because she cannot see herself from the point of view of her sister. The concrete operational child can easily answer such a question.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The years from 11 to 15 cover the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-formal-operational-stage" href="part0030_split_007.html#formal-operational-stage">formal operational stage</a>. During adolescence, the developing child becomes able to grasp highly abstract and hypothetical ideas. When faced with a problem, children at this stage are able to review all the possible ways of solving it and go through them theoretically to reach a solution. The young person at the formal operational stage can understand why some questions are trick ones. To the question, “What creatures are both poodles <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_118" title="118"></span>and dogs?” the individual might not be able to give the correct reply but will understand why the answer “poodles” is right and will appreciate the humor in it.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to Piaget, the first three stages of development are universal; but not all adults reach the formal operational stage. The development of formal operational thought depends in part on processes of schooling. Adults of limited educational attainment tend to continue to think in more concrete terms and retain large traces of egocentrism.</p>
