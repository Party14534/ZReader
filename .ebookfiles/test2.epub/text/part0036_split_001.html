<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Erving Goffman</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many of the concepts we have already reviewed were developed by Erving Goffman, the sociologist who did the most to create a new field of study focused on <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-interaction" href="part0036_split_004.html#social-interaction">social interaction</a>. Goffman believed that sociologists needed to concern themselves with seemingly trivial aspects of social behavior. His work on social interaction is just one example of the broader sociological subfield called microsociology. Sociologist Harold Garfinkel conceived this term to describe a field of study that focused on individual interaction and communication within small groups. This subfield stood in stark contrast with earlier sociological work, which historically had examined large social groups and societal-level behaviors.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The study of social interaction reveals important things about human social life. Passing someone on the street or exchanging a few words with a friend seem like minor and uninteresting activities, things we do countless times a day without giving them any thought. Goffman argued that the study of such apparently insignificant forms of social interaction is of major importance in sociology and, far from being uninteresting, is one of the most absorbing of all areas of sociological investigation. There are three reasons for this view.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">First, our day-to-day routines, with their almost constant interactions with others, give structure and form to what we do; we can learn a great deal about ourselves as social beings, and about social life itself, from studying them. Our lives are organized around the repetition of similar patterns of behavior from day to day, week to week, month to month, and year to year. Think of what you did yesterday, for example, and the day before that. If they were both weekdays, in all probability, you got up at about the same time each day (an important routine in itself). You may have gone off to class fairly early in the morning, making a journey from home to school or college that you make virtually every weekday. You perhaps met some friends for lunch, returning to classes or private study in the afternoon. Later, you retraced your steps back home or to your dorm, possibly going out later in the evening with other friends.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Of course, the routines we follow from day to day are not identical, and our patterns of activity on weekends usually contrast with those on weekdays. If we make a major change in our life, such as leaving college to take a job, alterations in our daily routines are usually necessary, but then we establish a new and fairly regular set of habits again.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Second, the study of everyday life reveals to us how humans can act creatively to shape reality. Although social behavior is guided to some extent by forces such as roles, norms, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_147" title="147"></span>and shared expectations, individuals also have <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-agency" href="part0036_split_004.html#agency">agency</a>, or the ability to act, think, and make choices independently (Emirbayer and Mische, 1998). The ways that people perceive reality may vary widely based on their backgrounds, interests, and motivations. Because individuals are capable of creative action, they continuously shape reality through their decisions and actions. In other words, reality is not fixed or static—it is created through human interactions.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Third, studying social interaction in everyday life sheds light on larger social systems and institutions. All large-scale social systems, in fact, depend on the patterns of social interaction we engage in daily. This idea is easy to demonstrate. Consider the case of two strangers passing on the street. Such an event may seem to have little direct relevance to large-scale, more permanent forms of social organization. But when we take into account many such interactions, they are no longer irrelevant. In modern societies, most people live in towns and cities and constantly interact with others whom they do not know personally. Civil inattention, a concept discussed earlier, is one of the mechanisms that gives public life—with its bustling crowds and fleeting, impersonal contacts—its distinctive character.</p>
