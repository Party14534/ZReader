<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the most distinctive features of human beings, compared with other animals, is that they are self-aware. How should we understand the emergence of a sense of self—the awareness that the individual has a distinct identity separate from others? During the first months of life, the infant possesses little or no understanding of differences between human beings and material objects and has no awareness of self. Children do not grasp concepts such as “I,” “me,” and “you” until the age of two or later. Only gradually do they understand that others have distinct identities, consciousnesses, and needs separate from their own.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The processes through which the self emerges and develops is much debated among contrasting theoretical perspectives. To some extent, this debate stems from the fact that the most prominent theories about child development emphasize different aspects of socialization. The American philosopher and sociologist George Herbert Mead mainly considered how children learn to use the concepts of “I” and “me.” <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_115" title="115"></span>Charles Horton Cooley demonstrated the importance of other individuals for shaping a child’s sense of self. Jean Piaget, the Swiss student of child behavior, studied many aspects of child development, but his best-known writings concern <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-cognition" href="part0030_split_007.html#cognition">cognition</a>—the ways in which children learn to think about themselves and their environment. Sigmund Freud and Nancy Chodorow focused on how children learn about gender differences and develop a gender identity.</p>
