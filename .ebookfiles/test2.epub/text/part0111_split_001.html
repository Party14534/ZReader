<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">With its estimated 2.4 billion followers—roughly a third of the world’s population—Christianity encompasses enormously divergent denominations, sects, and cults (CIA, 2020c). Common to all is the belief that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ (Messiah, or “anointed one”) foretold in the Hebrew Bible. Christianity is a form of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-monotheism" href="part0111_split_007.html#monotheism">monotheism</a>—belief in a single all-knowing, all-powerful God—although in most Christian faiths, God is also regarded as a trinity embracing a heavenly Father, His Son the Savior, and His sustaining Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When Christianity emerged in ancient Palestine some 2,000 years ago, it was a persecuted sect outside mainstream Jewish and Roman religious practices. Yet within four centuries, Christianity had become the official religion of the Roman Empire. In the eleventh century, Christianity divided into the Eastern Orthodox Church (based in Constantinople, now Istanbul) and the Catholic Church (based in Rome). A second great split occurred within the Catholic branch in the sixteenth century, when the Protestant Reformation gave rise to numerous Protestant denominations, sects, and cults. Protestants emphasize a direct relationship between the individual and God, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_670" title="670"></span>with each person being responsible for his or her own salvation. Catholics, in contrast, emphasize the importance of the Church hierarchy as the means to salvation, with the pope in Rome being the highest earthly authority.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Christianity was spread through conquest and missionary work. The European colonization of much of Africa, Asia, and North and South America that began in the fifteenth century brought Christian teachings, churches, and large-scale conversion of native peoples. In some places, converts were people from the impoverished classes, for whom Christianity was a means of social mobility. Only in Asia are Christians a small minority, largely because countries such as Japan and China successfully resisted most colonization and its accompanying Christianization.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">Every able-bodied Muslim who can afford to is obligated to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Pilgrims surround the Ka’aba, a small cube-shaped building that houses the Hajar al Aswad (the Black Stone). Muslims believe that this stone fell from the sky during the time of Adam and has the power to cleanse worshippers of their sins by absorbing them into itself. The stone is believed to have originally been white, but it is said to have turned black because of all the sins it has absorbed.</figcaption>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Recently, Protestant evangelical groups have increased their efforts to convert people throughout the world, making significant inroads in traditionally Catholic countries. Protestant missionaries from the United States not only “spread the Word,” but they also build homes and orphanages, help local people start small businesses, and engage in a variety of relief and development projects in the global south (Wuthnow, 2010). Local Protestant missionaries also play a key role. In Mexico, for example, the number of evangelical Protestants grew from 900,000 to 6.1 million between 1970 and 2000, owing to the efforts of local (Mexican) missionaries. Most of this increase has been in rural areas, including those areas where indigenous people predominate. The growth of evangelical Christianity may prove difficult to sustain. It makes considerable demands on its followers, so it remains to be seen whether the children of new converts will stay true to their parents’ faith once they become adults (Bowen, 1996; Dow, 2005).</p>

<section id="islam">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Islam</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As mentioned earlier, Islam is the second-largest, and the fastest-growing, religion in the world today. There were about 1.8 billion Muslims in the world in 2015, or 23 percent of the global population; that number is predicted to increase 70 percent to 3 billion (or 31 percent of the global population) by 2050, reaching near parity with the global Christian population (CIA, 2020c; Pew Research Center, 2017c). (<i class="italic">Muslim</i> is the word for those who practice <i class="italic">al-islam</i>, an Arabic term meaning submission without reservation to God’s will.)</p>
<figure class="figure--fullwidth" data-figure-id="ch17ph08"><a data-href="../images/Ch17ph08.jpg" tabindex="0" data-size="2700x1796"><img class="figure__image" alt="" src="../images/00258.jpeg" data-image-id="ch17ph08"/></a>
<figcaption class="figure__caption">Home to an estimated 13 percent of the global Muslim population, Indonesia is the largest Muslim country in the world.</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Islam began as a faith of the Arabs and other peoples of the Middle East and has spread into Africa, Central <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_671" title="671"></span>Asia, China, Europe, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Russia. Today, some 50 countries have Muslim-majority populations, while more than 60 different ethnic groups of a million or more people practice Islam. In fact, far more non-Arabs than Arabs identify as Muslims. Indonesia, for example, is by far the largest Muslim country in the world. With 232 million adherents, it is home to 13 percent of the global Muslim population (CIA, 2020b). A number of non-Muslim countries have large Muslim minorities, among them Hindu-majority India, with 188 million Muslims (14.2 percent of the population), Ethiopia (36.6 million, or 34 percent), and Russia (14.3 million, or 10 percent). Although less than 2 percent of China’s population is Muslim, the numbers are nonetheless large (25.1 million) (CIA Factbook, 2020c). In 2010, there were 43.5 million Muslims living in Europe, about 6 percent of the total European population (Pew Research Center, 2015c), mostly immigrants seeking better economic opportunities.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Muslims believe in absolute, unquestioning, positive devotion to Allah (God) (Aslan, 2006). Although modern Islam dates to the Arab prophet Muhammad (c. 570–632), Muslims trace their religion to the ancient Hebrew prophet Abraham, also regarded as the founder of Judaism. The precepts of Islam are believed to have been revealed to Muhammad and are contained in a sacred book dictated to his followers, called the Qur’an (the common English form of the book’s name, which means “recitation”). Muhammad’s ideas were not accepted in his birthplace of Mecca, so in 622, he and his followers moved to Medina (both in what is today Saudi Arabia). This migration, called the <i class="italic">hegira</i>, marks the beginning of Islam, which soon spread throughout Arabia. Muslims do not worship Muhammad but regard him as a great teacher and prophet, the last in a line that includes Abraham, Noah, Moses, and Jesus.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Islam is an all-encompassing religion. The sacred <i class="italic">sharia</i> (“way”) includes prescriptions for worship, daily life, ethics, and government. Although U.S. standards might find Muslim beliefs to be extremely restrictive, Muslims frequently view American life as spiritually undisciplined, corrupt, and immoral (Abdul-Rauf, 1975; Arjomand, 1988; Esposito, 1984; Kedouri, 1992; MacEnoin and al-Shahi, 1983; Martin, 1982).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Islam, like Christianity, comprises different religious groups. The principal division is between Sunnis (about 87–90 percent of all Muslims) and Shiites (about 10–13 percent) (Pew Research Center, 2015a). Sunni Muslims follow a series of traditions deriving from the Qur’an that tolerate a diversity of opinion, in contrast to the more rigid views of Shiites. Shiism split from the main body of orthodox Islam early in its history and has remained influential ever since. Iran (once known as Persia) is the only major Islamic country that is overwhelmingly Shiite, although there are Shiite majorities in several other countries, including Iraq. Large numbers of Shiites are found in other Middle Eastern countries and in Turkey, Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan. A <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_672" title="672"></span>sect known as Sufism encompasses more mysticism and rituals than the practice by Sunnis and Shiites (Pew Research Center, 2012b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Shiism has been the official religion of Iran since the sixteenth century and was fundamental to the religiously conservative Iranian Revolution of 1978–1979. The Shiites trace their beginnings to Imam Ali, a seventh-century religious and political leader who showed outstanding virtue and personal devotion to God. Ali’s descendants were considered the rightful leaders of Islam because they were held to belong to the prophet Muhammad’s family, unlike the dynasties actually in power. The Shiites believed that the rule of Muhammad’s rightful heir would eventually be instituted, doing away with the tyrannies and injustices associated with existing regimes. Muhammad’s heir would be a leader directly guided by God, governing in accordance with the Qur’an.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There is no separation of church and state in a few highly religious Islamic societies, such as Iran. In most Muslim countries, however, religious leaders live in uneasy alliance with secular governments. Algeria, Egypt, Indonesia, and Turkey, for example, are all predominantly Muslim societies in which mosque and state are separate. As we noted in <a href="part0083_split_000.html#2F4UM0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 13</a>, even countries such as Jordan, Morocco, and Turkey, where more religiously traditional Islamist parties have won recent elections, have not lost basic democratic values or the fundamental separation of mosque and state.</p>

<section id="judaism">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Judaism</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">With 15.3 million followers worldwide, Judaism is by far the smallest of the world’s major religions. Jews were among the first people to practice monotheism. According to Jewish beliefs, some 3,500 years ago, God entered into a covenant with Abraham, a descendant of Noah: Abraham was to spread the word of God, and he in turn would father a “great nation” (Genesis 12:2) in the land that now includes Israel. As a symbol of this covenant, all the male descendants of Abraham were to be circumcised in a ritual ceremony eight days after birth.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The story of Abraham and his descendants is told in the first five books of the Bible, called the Torah (“teachings” or “law”), which provides a foundation for Jewish religious beliefs (as well as those of the other “Abrahamic” traditions, Christianity and Islam). These teachings include the Ten Commandments, which, according to the Torah, were among the laws God revealed to Moses during the 40 years the Jews were wandering in the Sinai Desert after escaping from Egyptian slavery. According to Jewish tradition, the entire Torah is read in an annual cycle during religious services. The Jewish Bible is made up of 24 books: the Torah, the writings of the prophets, philosophical works (for example, the Book of Job), and poetry (such as the Psalms). In the Christian tradition, these books are collectively known as the Old Testament, to distinguish them from the New Testament, which focuses on the story and teachings of Jesus. Later texts that are central to Jewish beliefs include the Talmud, a compendium of the debates and teachings of Jewish rabbis (religious teachers) over many centuries.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">After their desert wanderings, the Jews eventually conquered the land promised by God to Abraham, encompassing what is today Israel, Lebanon, and the west bank of the Jordan River, along with coastal parts of Jordan, Egypt, and Syria. Jerusalem became the religious center and political capital of the Jewish nation some 3,000 years ago, although it was conquered numerous times by various empires during the next thousand years. During times of conquest, some Jews began to flee to other countries, in what later became known as the Diaspora (exile or “scattering”). During the first century after Jesus, the Diaspora became complete: Following an unsuccessful revolt <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_673" title="673"></span>against their Roman conquerors, the remaining Jews were forced to settle throughout Europe and parts of North Africa and the Middle East. Throughout this period, religious Jews lamented the loss of Jerusalem; every year, after recounting the escape of the Jews from Egyptian slavery during the ritual Passover meal called the <i class="italic">seder</i> (“order”), the vow was made: “next year in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Judaism has exerted an influence greater than its limited numbers would suggest. First, as noted, it is the source of the world’s two largest religions, Christianity and Islam. Second, in European and U.S. culture, Jews have played a role disproportionate to their numbers in such diverse fields as music, literature, science, education, and business. Third, the existence of Israel as a Jewish state since 1948 has given the Jewish faith international prominence. Israel has existed in nearly constant tension with many of its neighboring Arab countries since its founding and has seldom been out of the news.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Jews have often suffered persecution. From the twelfth century on, European and Russian Jews were often forced to live in special districts termed “ghettos,” where they lacked full rights as citizens and were sometimes the target of harassment, attacks, and murders. Partly in reaction to these conditions, and partly because the Torah identifies the city of Jerusalem as the center of the Jewish homeland, some Jews embraced <i class="italic">Zionism</i>, a movement calling for the return of Jews to ancient Palestine and the creation of a Jewish state. (Zion is a biblical name for the ancient city of Jerusalem.) Although secular Zionists viewed Israel as a country where persecuted Jews could seek refuge, religious Zionists saw it as the one Jewish homeland and saw returning to it as fulfilling biblical prophecies. Zionists established settlements in Palestine early in the twentieth century, living relatively peacefully with their Arab and Palestinian neighbors. However, after World War II and the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, the League of Nations, and subsequently the United Nations, approved the creation of the state of Israel as a homeland for the survivors. This action ended the once relatively peaceful relationship between Zionists and their neighbors.</p>

<section id="hinduism">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_4">Hinduism</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Hinduism, which dates to about 2000 <small class="smallcaps">B.C.E</small>., is one of the world’s oldest religions. It is not based on the teachings of any individual, and its followers do not trace their national origins to a single god. Hinduism is an ethical religion that calls for an ideal way of life. There were just over 1 billion Hindus worldwide in 2020, comprising 15 percent of the global population; 94 percent of the world’s Hindu population (974 million) lives in India, comprising 80 percent of India’s population (Pew Research Center, 2017c). Nepal and Bangladesh follow far behind with 24.6 and 16.2 million Hindus, respectively (CIA, 2020c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we saw in <a href="part0053_split_000.html#1IHDQ0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 8</a>, India’s social structure is characterized by a caste system in which people are believed to be born into a certain status that they occupy for life. Although the caste system was officially abolished in 1949, it remains powerful. The caste system has its origins in Hindu beliefs that hold that an ideal life is partly achieved by performing the duties appropriate to one’s caste.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Perhaps because Hinduism does not have a central organization or leader, its philosophy and practice are extremely diverse. Religious teachings direct all aspects of life, but in a variety of ways—ranging from promoting the enjoyment of sensual pleasures to advising the renunciation of earthly pursuits. Mohandas Gandhi was a modern example of a man who devoted his life to the Hindu virtues of “honesty, courage, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_674" title="674"></span>service, faith, self-control, purity, and nonviolence” (Potter, 1992).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Despite the teaching that life is <i class="italic">maya</i>, or “illusion,” Hindu religious beliefs have an earthly quality. For example, although temples and pilgrimage centers are located on sacred sites, any location may be a place of devotion. Hindus believe in the godlike unity of all things, yet their religion also has aspects of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-polytheism" href="part0111_split_007.html#polytheism">polytheism</a>—the belief that different gods represent various categories of natural forces. For example, Hindus worship gods representing aspects of the whole, such as the divine dimension of a spiritual teacher (Basham, 1989; Kinsley, 1982; Potter, 1992; Schmidt, 1980).</p>
