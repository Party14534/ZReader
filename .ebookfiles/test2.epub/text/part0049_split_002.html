<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, the United States locks up more people (nearly all men) per capita than any other country and has by far the most punitive justice system in the world. Although the United States makes up only 4.3 percent of the world’s overall population, it accounts for more than 20 percent of the world’s prisoners (Walmsley, 2018). The so-called “prison boom” began in the 1970s, with the number of inmates nearly quintupling—from roughly 100 inmates per 100,000 residents for most of the twentieth century to 486 inmates per 100,000 residents by 2004 (Pager, 2007). More than 2.1 million people are currently incarcerated in American prisons and jails, with another nearly 4.7 million falling under the jurisdiction of the penal system (Walmsley, 2018; Kaeble and Glaze, 2016; McDonough, 2005; Slevin, 2005).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The American prison system employs more than 700,000 people and costs more than $81 billion annually to maintain (Wagner &amp; Rabuy, 2017; Kyckelhahn, 2015; Slevin, 2005). The price of imprisoning an individual is enormous; it costs an average of $31,977 to keep a prisoner in the federal prison system for one year (Qureshi, 2016). The system has also become partially privatized, with private companies building and administering prisons to accommodate the growing inmate population. Critics claim that a “prison-industrial complex” has emerged. Large numbers of people—including bureaucrats, politicians, and prison employees—have vested interests in the existence and further expansion of the prison system.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Mass incarceration has had a particularly deleterious effect on Black communities; indeed, African Americans make up around 33 percent of the current prison population, though they represent only 12 percent of the U.S. population (Gramlich, 2019b). In <i class="italic">The New Jim Crow</i>, legal scholar Michelle Alexander (2012) argues that mass incarceration creates a kind of caste system in the United States. According to Alexander, understanding mass incarceration means understanding not only the criminal justice system, but also the entire structure of policies and practices that stigmatize and marginalize those who are considered criminals (Alexander, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These policies and practices affect individuals even after they have been released from prison. In <i class="italic">Marked,</i> Devah Pager (2007) focuses on the difficulties former inmates face when attempting to find jobs upon release. Given that the ex-inmate population is approximately six times that of the inmate population, Pager argues that it is of critical importance to understand the types of policies governing prisoner re-entry into society (Pager, 2007). By conducting an experiment that involved having both Black and White applicants apply to entry-level positions in Milwaukee, Pager found <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_214" title="214"></span>that Whites were much preferred over Blacks, and non-offenders were much preferred over ex-offenders. Employers were half as likely to consider Whites with a felony conviction as equally qualified non-offenders. For Blacks, the effects were even greater. Black ex-offenders were only one-third as likely to receive a callback compared to non-offenders. But most surprising was the comparison of these two effects: Blacks with no criminal history fared no better than did Whites with a felony conviction! Essentially, these results suggest that being a Black male in America today is about the same as being a convicted criminal, at least in the eyes of Milwaukee employers. For those who believe that race no longer represents a major barrier to opportunity, these results represent a powerful challenge.</p>
