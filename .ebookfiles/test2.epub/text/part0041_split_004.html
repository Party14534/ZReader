<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">Organizations</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">People frequently band together to pursue activities that they cannot do by themselves. A principal means of accomplishing such cooperative actions—whether it’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_174" title="174"></span>raising money for ALS research, winning a football game, or becoming a profitable corporation—is the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-organization" href="part0041_split_005.html#organization">organization</a>, a group with an identifiable membership that engages in concerted collective actions to achieve a common purpose (Aldrich and Marsden, 1988). An organization can be a small primary group, but it is more likely a larger secondary one. Universities, religious bodies, and business corporations are all examples of organizations. Such organizations are a central feature of all societies, and their study is a core concern of sociology.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Organizations tend to be highly formal in modern industrial and postindustrial societies. A <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-formal-organization" href="part0041_split_005.html#formal-organization">formal organization</a> is designed to achieve its objectives, often by means of explicit rules, regulations, and procedures. The modern bureaucratic organization, discussed later in this chapter, is a prime example of a formal organization. As Max Weber (1979; orig. 1921) recognized almost a century ago, there has been a long-term trend in Europe and North America toward formal organizations, in part because formality is often a requirement for legal standing. For a college or university to be accredited, for example, it must satisfy explicit written standards governing everything from grading policy to faculty performance to fire codes. Today, formal organizations are the dominant form of organization throughout the world.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Social systems in the traditional world developed as a result of custom and habit. Modern organizations are designed with definite aims and housed in buildings or physical settings constructed to help realize those aims. Organizations play a more important part in our everyday lives than ever before. Besides delivering us into this world (hospital), they also mark our progress through it (school) and see us out of it when we die (hospital, funeral home). Even before we are born, our mothers, and often our fathers, are involved in birthing classes, pregnancy checkups, and so forth, all carried out within hospitals and other medical organizations. Today, every child born is registered by government organizations, which collect information on all of us from birth to death. Most people today die in a hospital—not at home, as was once the case—and each death must be formally registered with the government.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is easy to see why organizations are so important today. In the premodern world, families, relatives, and neighbors provided for most needs—food, the instruction of children, work, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_175" title="175"></span>and leisure-time activities. In modern times, many of our requirements are filled by people we never meet and who might live and work thousands of miles away. Substantial coordination of activities and resources—which organizations provide—is needed in such circumstances.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">But the tremendous influence organizations have on our lives cannot be seen as wholly beneficial. Organizations often take things out of our own hands and put them under the control of officials or experts over whom we have little influence. For instance, we are required to do certain things the government tells us to do—pay taxes, obey laws, fight wars—or face punishment. As sources of social power, organizations can subject people to dictates they may be powerless to resist.</p>
