<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">During the writing of all twelve editions of this book, many individuals offered comments and advice on particular chapters and, in some cases, large parts of the text. They helped us see issues in a different light, clarified some difficult points, and allowed us to take advantage of their specialized knowledge in their respective fields. We are deeply indebted to them. Special thanks go to Aleksandra Malinowska, who worked assiduously to help us update data in all chapters and contributed significantly to the editing process.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We would also like to thank the many readers of the text who have written with comments, criticisms, and suggestions for improvements. We have adopted many of their recommendations in this new edition.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We have many others to thank as well. We are extremely grateful to project editor Caitlin Moran, production manager Stephen Sajdak, and editorial assistant Angie Merila for managing the myriad details involved in producing this book. Media editor Eileen Connell and associate media editor Ariel Eaton deserve special thanks for creating all the rich materials, including the InQuizitive course, test bank, DVDs, and other instructor-support materials that accompany the book. Cat Abelman and Elyse Rieder painstakingly researched the best photos to grace these pages. Art director Rubina Yeh, designer Marisa Nakasone, and Kiss Me I’m Polish showed exceptional flair and originality in designing and illustrating the book.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We are also grateful to our editors at Norton, Steve Dunn, Melea Seward, Karl Bakeman, Sasha Levitt, and Michael Moss, who have made many direct contributions to the various chapters, and have ensured that we made reference to the very latest research. We would also like to register our thanks to a number of current and former graduate students—many of whom are now tenured professors at prestigious universities—whose contributions over the years have proved invaluable: Wendy Carter, Joe Conti, Francesca Degiuli, Audrey Devine-Eller, Neha Gondal, Neil Gross, Black Hawk Hancock, Dmitry Khodyakov, Paul LePore, Alair MacLean, Ann Meier, Susan Munkres, Josh Rossol, Sharmila Rudrappa, Christopher Wildeman, David Yamane, and Kathrin Zippel.</p>
