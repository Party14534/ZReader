<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Wealth and poverty make life different in a host of ways. The Food and Agriculture Organization (2019b) estimates that 822 million people, roughly one in nine people in the world, suffer from chronic hunger, up from 785 million in 2015—the vast majority of whom live in developing countries. More than half of the world’s hungry are found in Asia and the Pacific; approximately one-quarter are in sub-Saharan Africa. In Southern Asia alone, nearly 272 million people are undernourished, representing 15 percent of the population; 23 percent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa is undernourished. Almost all of them are illiterate, and many lack access to even primary school education. By mid-century, when the world population is projected to grow from its present level (roughly 7.7 billion) to nearly 9.7 billion people, there will <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_306" title="306"></span>be 2 billion more mouths to feed. That number increases to 3.2 billion more by the next century—most of them in the poorest countries (UN DESA, 2019). And under worst-case projections—if birth rates don’t fall throughout the world as predicted—there may be as many as 13.2 billion people by the end of the century, an additional 5.5 billion people (UN DESA, 2017). More than half of the world’s population (55 percent) lived in urban areas in 2018, a figure that is predicted to increase to 68 percent by 2050, when an estimated 2.5 billion additional people will swell the world’s cities. The overwhelming majority of this increase will be in Asia (especially China and India) and Africa (UN DESA, 2019). Giant cities in poorer countries bring with them their own problems: Overcrowding, squalid slums, large homeless populations, and the need to supply fuel, food, and water over long distances.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Future population growth will have an enormous impact on global resources and the world ecosystem. We take up these issues in greater detail in <a href="part0121_split_000.html#3JCK20-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 19</a>. Here we look at the differences among high- and low-income countries in terms of health, hunger, and education.</p>
