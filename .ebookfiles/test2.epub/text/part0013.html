<h1 class="calibre1" id="calibre_pb_0">4 HOW CAN SOCIOLOGY HELP US?</h1>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we discussed at the beginning of the chapter, sociological thinking is relevant to your day-to-day life—from understanding the profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to the actual value of going to a fancy college. C. Wright Mills emphasized these practical applications of sociology when developing his idea of the sociological imagination. When we observe the world through the prism of the sociological imagination, we are affected in several important ways.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">First, sociology allows us to see the social world from many perspectives. If we properly understand how others live, we better understand their problems. Practical policies that lack an informed awareness of the ways of life of the people they affect have little chance of success. Thus, a White social worker operating in a predominately Black community won’t gain the confidence of its members if he or she isn’t sensitive to the differences in social experiences of Whites and Blacks in the United States.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Second, we are better able to assess the results of public-policy initiatives. For example, a program of practical reform may fail to achieve its goals or may produce unintended negative consequences. Consider the large public-housing blocks built in city centers in many countries following World War II. The goal was to provide high standards of accommodation for low-income groups from slum areas and to offer shopping amenities and other civic services close at hand. However, research later showed that many people who moved to the large apartment blocks felt isolated and unhappy. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_27" title="27"></span>High-rise apartment blocks and shopping malls in poorer areas often became dilapidated and provided breeding grounds for muggings and other violent crimes.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Third, and perhaps most important, sociology can provide us with self-enlightenment—increased self-understanding. The more we know about our own behavior and how our society works, the better chance we have to influence our futures. Sociology doesn’t just help policy makers make informed decisions. Those in power may not always consider the interests of the less powerful or underprivileged when making policies. Self-enlightened groups can benefit from sociological research by using the information gleaned to respond to government policies or form policy initiatives of their own. Self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and social movements such as the environmental movement are examples of social groups that have directly sought practical reforms, with some success.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Finally, developing a sociological eye toward social problems and developing rigorous research skills opens many career doors—as industrial consultants, urban planners, social workers, and personnel managers, among other jobs. An understanding of society also serves those working in law, journalism, business, and medicine.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Those who study sociology frequently develop a social conscience. Should sociologists themselves agitate for programs of reform or social change? Some argue that sociology can preserve its intellectual independence only if sociologists remain neutral in moral and political controversies. Yet are scholars who remain aloof more impartial in their assessment of sociological issues than others? No sociologically sophisticated person can be unaware of the inequalities, the lack of social justice, or the deprivations suffered by millions of people worldwide. It would be strange if sociologists did not take sides on practical issues, and it would be illogical to ban them from drawing on their expertise in doing so.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We have seen that sociology is a discipline in which we often set aside our personal views to explore the influences that shape our lives and those of others. Sociology emerged as an intellectual endeavor along with the development of modern societies, and the study of such societies remains its principal concern. But sociologists are also preoccupied with the nature of social interaction and human societies in general.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociology has major practical implications for people’s lives. Learning to become a sociologist shouldn’t be a dull academic endeavor but rather an exciting pursuit! The best way to make sure the pursuit is exciting is to approach the subject in an imaginative way and to relate sociological ideas and findings to your own life.</p>
