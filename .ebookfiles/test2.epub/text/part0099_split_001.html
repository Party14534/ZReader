<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Changes in Family Patterns Worldwide</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many family forms exist today. In some areas, such as remote regions in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Rim, traditional family systems are changing slowly, with most still maintaining or aspiring to one lifelong marriage with children. In most wealthy countries, however, changes are occurring rapidly. In some nations in Western and Northern Europe, for instance, only a minority will ever marry, with most preferring to cohabit with their romantic partner. Among the complex origins of these changes is the spread of Western ideals of romantic love. Another is the development of centralized government in areas previously comprising autonomous smaller societies. People’s lives become influenced by their involvement in a national political system; moreover, governments attempt to alter traditional ways of behavior. Because of rapid population growth, states frequently introduce programs advocating smaller families, the use of contraception, and so forth.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, employment opportunities away from the land and in organizations such as government bureaucracies, mines, plantations, and industrial firms disrupt family systems previously centered on landed production in the local community.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These changes have created worldwide movement toward the predominance of the nuclear family, breaking down extended-family systems and other types of kinship groups. This movement was first documented by William J. Goode in his book <i class="italic">World Revolution in Family Patterns</i> (1963) and has been borne out by subsequent research. Building on Goode’s work, sociologists have identified seven important changes that have characterized global family change over the past half-century:</p>
<ol class="fmnl">
<li class="bcpt" value="1">Clans and other kin groups are declining in influence.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="2">There is a general trend toward the free choice of a spouse or romantic partner.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="3">The rights of women are more widely recognized, with respect both to initiating marriage and to making decisions within families.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="4">Kin marriages are less common.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="5">Higher levels of sexual freedom are developing in societies that were formerly very restrictive.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="6"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_577" title="577"></span>Birth rates are declining, meaning that women are giving birth to fewer babies.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="7">There is a general trend toward extending children’s rights.</li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In many countries, especially Western industrial societies, five additional trends have occurred within the past four decades:</p>
<ol class="fmnl">
<li class="bcpt" value="1">An increase in the number of births that occur outside of marriage.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="2">A liberalization of laws and norms regarding divorce.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="3">An increase in nonmarital cohabitation among romantic partners.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="4">An increasing age at first marriage and first birth.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="5">A growing number of and cultural and legal acceptance for same-sex couples.</li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Countries vary widely in how rapidly these changes are occurring (Ng, 2016). For instance, most nations in Asia are witnessing a rapid transition in family life, with divorce rates rising, family size decreasing, and multigenerational families declining in number, a function of young adults’ desire for autonomy and independence, and turning away from Confucian values (Ng, 2016). For instance, the divorce rate in Japan increased 66 percent between 1980 and 2012, while the rate in the United States decreased by roughly 25 percent during that period (OECD, 2019). Currently, divorce rates in the United States are higher than in Japan (2.9 vs. 1.7 per 1,000 population). Other nations are witnessing dramatic shifts in the types of unions young adults enter. Only a minority of young adults ultimately marry in Scandinavian nations; they instead form long-term cohabiting relationships in which they bear and rear children. In 2014, fully 70 percent of births in Iceland were to unmarried parents; rates were just slightly lower in Sweden and Norway. However, nearly all these births were to cohabiting partners in committed long-term relationships (Chamie, 2016). Though, cohabiting unions are more likely than marital unions to dissolve—both in Europe and the United States—lending some instability to the lives of children born or adopted into those unions (Wilcox and DeRose, 2017).</p>
