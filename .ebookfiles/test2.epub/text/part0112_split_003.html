<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Is Religious Violence on the Rise?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is important to remember that before the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon by Islamist fanatics associated with Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil occurred at the hands of a Christian fanatic. On April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh, a former U.S. Army soldier who believed the United States was dominated by an anti-Christian conspiracy, ignited a <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_698" title="698"></span>truck laden with explosives in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. One hundred and sixty-eight people died in the enormous blast, including 19 children under six years old in the building’s day-care center. Nearly 700 additional people were injured in the blast, which also damaged hundreds of other nearby buildings. McVeigh, who was later executed for the attack, believed he was waging a “cosmic war” against his version of the unfaithful (Juergensmeyer, 2008).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Understandably, since 9/11, many Americans have been concerned about the global spread of Islamic violence, a concern that contributes to false stereotypes about a relationship between Islam and violence. The rise of ISIS, suicide bombings, the Islamist attack that claimed 12 lives at the French satirical magazine <i class="italic">Charlie Hebdo</i> because it had caricatured the Prophet Muhammad—all these understandably raise the question, How could Islamic religious views—or any religious views—give rise to such a culture of violence? Sociologist Mark Juergensmeyer (2001, 2009; see also Aslan, 2009) has come to a startling conclusion: Even though all major religious traditions call for compassion and understanding, violence and religion nonetheless go hand in hand. Juergensmeyer, who has studied religious violence among Muslims, Sikhs, Jews, Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists, argues that under the right conditions, ordinary conflicts can become recast as religious “cosmic wars” between good and evil that must be won at all costs. He argues that a violent conflict is most likely to seek religious justification as a cosmic war when (1) the conflict is regarded as decisive for defending one’s basic identity and dignity—for example, when one’s culture is seen as threatened—and (2) when losing the conflict is unthinkable, although (3) winning the conflict is unlikely.</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">If any of these conditions is present, Juergensmeyer says, it is more likely that a real-world struggle may be perceived in cosmic terms as a sacred war. The occurrence of all three simultaneously strongly suggests it. A struggle that begins on worldly terms may gradually take on the characteristics of a cosmic war as solutions become unlikely and awareness grows of how devastating it would be to lose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In such instances, the proponents of cosmic warfare justify the loss of innocent lives as serving God’s larger purpose. Juergensmeyer also argues that responding to violence with still greater violence runs the risk of showing the Islamic world that the conflict is indeed cosmic, particularly if the most powerful nations on earth become embroiled. Based on interviews with proponents of terrorism, Juergensmeyer concludes that this is just what al Qaeda wants—to be elevated from the status of a minor criminal terrorist organization to a worthy opponent in a global war against the West. This will increase the appeal of al Qaeda to a wider group of young Islamic men who blame the West for declining Islamic influence and growing hardships many Muslims worldwide face.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">To what extent are bin Laden’s views about “Westoxification” shared in the Muslim world? The Pew Research Center (2003) polled 50,000 people worldwide in 2002 and 2003, not long after the 9/11 attacks. Large majorities, including Muslims, reported that such things as television, the Internet, and cell phones were making their lives better. (Pakistan, one of the world’s largest Islamic countries, was a notable exception.) <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_699" title="699"></span>Most people, including most Muslims, felt that foreign TV, movies, and music were a “good thing” (again, except in Pakistan). At the same time, large majorities of Muslims and others also believed that their traditional ways of life were being lost and needed protection against foreign influence.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although expressing concern that “there are serious threats to Islam today,” the vast majority of Muslims reject suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilians as a legitimate means of “defending Islam against its enemies.” Recent surveys have found that the vast majority of respondents in Muslim-majority countries have unfavorable views of ISIS, including nearly all respondents in Lebanon and 94 percent in Jordan (Lipka, 2017). A 2017 survey by the Pew Research Center found that ISIS is globally considered the top threat to national security, closely followed by global climate change (Poushter and Manevich, 2017). By 2018, the Global Attitudes Survey found that climate change was considered globally as the top threat to national security, followed by ISIS, and cyberattacks (Poushter and Huang, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Bin Laden’s belief that “Westoxification” is a serious problem calling for a violent solution is clearly not widely shared among ordinary Muslims.</p>
