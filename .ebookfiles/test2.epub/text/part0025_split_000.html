<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">From the seventeenth to the early twentieth century, Western countries established colonies in numerous areas previously occupied by traditional societies. Although all these colonies have by now attained independence, the process of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-colonialism" href="part0025_split_003.html#colonialism">colonialism</a> helped shape the social map of the globe as we know it today. In some regions, such as North America, Australia, and New Zealand, which were only thinly populated by hunting and gathering or pastoral communities, Europeans became the majority population. In North America, the native population was greatly reduced by the spread of European diseases, as well as through conquest (Diamond, 1999). This form of colonialism is sometimes referred to as <i class="italic">settler colonialism</i> because it took the form of large-scale European settlement (Veracini, 2010). In other areas, including much of Asia, Africa, and South America, the local populations remained in the majority and were governed by the colonial powers, largely for the benefit of the home country.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Societies created through settler colonialism, including the United States, have become industrialized. Those with large native populations ruled by colonial administrators experienced a much lower level of industrial development, largely because much of the wealth produced in these societies was realized by the colonial powers. These included South Asia, as well as much of Africa and Latin America. Colonialism had come to an end by the mid-twentieth century, and today, many of these societies are experiencing rapid economic growth. Some, such as India and Brazil, are currently major drivers of global economic growth (Nederveen Pieterse, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There is no agreed-upon way of classifying countries in terms of their degree of industrialization. While it was once common to distinguish between “developed” and “developing” countries, it is not surprising that members of the latter category objected to being characterized as “developing,” on the grounds that it privileged the “developed” countries of the world as being somehow more advanced. They saw this both as an invidious cultural judgment and as ignoring the role of colonialism in shaping their adverse economic situations. Among sociologists, a commonly used distinction is between the “global north” and the “global south,” since most (but not all) of what was once referred to as the industrialized world is found in the Northern Hemisphere, while most (but not all) of what was called the developing world lies in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These different ways of characterizing the world today highlight the importance of language and reflect an increased sensitivity, at least among scholars of globalization, to the ways in which words can shape our perceptions, unconsciously elevating some societies to a more “advanced” status, while unconsciously denigrating others. We shall use the terms <i class="italic">global north</i> and <i class="italic">global south</i>, imperfect as they are, because they are least likely to imply a judgment about which is culturally preferable.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is important to recognize that power relations are culturally embedded. The French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1986) introduced the concept of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-cultural-capital" href="part0025_split_003.html#cultural-capital">cultural capital</a>, the accumulated cultural knowledge within a society that confers power and status <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_75" title="75"></span>(Barker, 2004). In Bourdieu’s formulation, there are three kinds of cultural capital, each of which is strongly influenced by one’s socioeconomic position in society: the first is what a person embodies in his or her very person (for example, one’s way of dressing and speaking, and one’s mannerisms); the next is reflected in the material objects one possesses (such as one’s home, car, or computer); and the last is socially determined by larger institutions (such as the academic credentials required for a particular job). In the United States, for example, a person could be said to possess a great deal of cultural capital if he or she were articulate and persuasive in English language skills; had access to high-end computers and the software required to run complex business programs; and possessed the advanced degrees necessary for a highly paid job with an investment firm.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although there are always exceptions, those who possess the cultural capital valued in any society enjoy clear advantages over those who do not. Since cultural capital reflects socioeconomic status, it can reinforce existing patterns of economic and political inequality.</p>
