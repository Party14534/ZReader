<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, floods of refugees and emigrants move restlessly across different regions of the globe, either escaping conflicts or fleeing poverty in search of a better life. Often they reach a new country only to face resentment from people whose forebears were immigrants themselves. Sometimes there are reversals, as in some areas of the United States along the Mexican border. Much of what is now California was once part of Mexico. Today, some Mexican Americans might say the new waves of Mexican immigrants are reclaiming what used to be their heritage—except that most of the existing groups in California don’t quite see things this way.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Migratory Movements</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Migration is accelerating as part of the process of global integration. Worldwide migration patterns reflect the rapidly changing economic, political, and cultural ties among countries (Global Map 11.2). It has been estimated that the world’s migrant population in 1990 was more than 150 million people. In 2015, the number of migrants was estimated at nearly 244 million. Europe and Asia are home to nearly two-thirds of all international migrants (UN Population Division, 2015). The number will likely continue to increase in the twenty-first century, prompting some scholars to label this the “age of migration” (Castles and Miller, 1993). In fact, the Census Bureau projects that nearly one in five Americans will be foreign-born by 2060 (Trevelyan et al., 2016).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-immigration" href="part0074_split_007.html#immigration">Immigration</a>, the movement of people into a country to settle, and <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-emigration" href="part0074_split_007.html#emigration">emigration</a>, the process by which people leave a country to settle in another, combine to produce global migration patterns linking countries of origin and countries of destination. Migratory movements add to ethnic and cultural diversity and affect demographic, economic, and social dynamics. Rising immigration rates in many Western societies have challenged commonly held notions of national identity and have forced a reexamination of concepts of citizenship.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Scholars offer four models of migration to describe the main global population movements since 1945. The <i class="italic">classic model</i> applies to countries such as Canada, the United States, and Australia, which developed as nations of immigrants. These countries have encouraged immigration and promised citizenship to newcomers, although restrictions and quotas limit the annual intake. The <i class="italic">colonial model</i> of immigration, pursued by countries such as France and the United Kingdom, grants preferences <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_400" title="400"></span>to immigrants from former colonies. Countries such as Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium have followed the <i class="italic">guest workers model</i>: Immigrants are admitted on a temporary basis, often to fulfill demands within the labor market, but they do not receive citizenship rights, even after long periods of settlement. Finally, <i class="italic">illegal models</i> of immigration are increasingly common because of tightening immigration laws in many industrialized countries. Immigrants who gain entry into a country either secretly or under a nonimmigration pretense often live illegally, outside the realm of official society. Examples include undocumented Mexican immigrants in many Southern U.S. states and the refugees smuggled across national borders (part of a growing international business).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What are the forces behind global migration, and how are they changing as a result of globalization? Many early theories focused on push-and-pull factors. <i class="italic">Push factors</i> are dynamics within a country of origin that force people to emigrate, such as war, famine, political oppression, and population pressures. <i class="italic">Pull factors</i> are features of destination countries that attract immigrants, such as prosperous labor markets, better living conditions, and lower population density.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Recently, push-and-pull theories have been criticized for offering overly simplistic explanations of a multifaceted process. Instead, scholars of migration are regarding global migration patterns as systems produced through interactions between macro-level and micro-level processes. <i class="italic">Macro-level</i> factors refer to overarching issues such as the political situation in an area, laws and regulations controlling immigration and emigration, and changes in the international economy. <i class="italic">Micro-level</i> factors are concerned with the resources, knowledge, and understandings that the migrant populations possess.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The intersection of macro and micro processes is evident in Germany’s large Turkish immigrant community. On the macro level are factors such as Germany’s economic need for labor, its policy of accepting foreign “guest workers,” and the state of the Turkish economy, which prevents many Turks from earning at a satisfactory level. On the micro level are the informal networks and channels of mutual support within the Turkish community in Germany and the strong links to family and friends in Turkey. Among potential Turkish migrants, knowledge about Germany and its “social capital”—its human or community resources—makes Germany one of the most popular destination countries. Supporters of the migration systems approach emphasize that no single factor can explain the process of migration. Rather, each migratory movement, like that between Turkey and Germany, is the product of an interaction between macro- and micro-level processes.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Stephen Castles and Mark Miller (1993) identified four tendencies that they claim will characterize migration patterns in the coming years:</p>
<ol class="fmnl">
<li class="bcpt" value="1"><b class="bold1">Acceleration</b>: Migration across borders is occurring in greater numbers than ever before.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="2"><b class="bold1">Diversification</b>: Most countries now receive immigrants of many different types—in contrast with earlier times, when particular forms of immigration, such as labor immigration or refugees, were predominant.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="3"><b class="bold1">Globalization</b>: Migration has become more global, involving a greater number of countries as both senders and recipients.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_401" title="401"></span><b class="bold1">Feminization</b>: A growing number of migrants are women, making contemporary migration much less male-dominated than previously. The increase reflects changes in the global labor market, including the growing demand for domestic workers, the expansion of sex tourism, “trafficking” in women, and the “mail-order brides” phenomenon.</li>

<section id="global-diasporas">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Global Diasporas</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The term <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-diaspora" href="part0074_split_007.html#diaspora">diaspora</a> refers to the dispersal of an ethnic population from a homeland into foreign areas, often in a forced manner or under traumatic circumstances. Although members of a diaspora are scattered geographically, they are held together by factors such as a shared history, a collective memory of the homeland, or a common ethnic identity that is nurtured and preserved.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Robin Cohen has argued that diasporas occur in various forms, although the most commonly cited examples are those that result from persecution and violence. In <i class="italic">Global Diasporas</i> (1997), Cohen adopts a historical approach and identifies five categories of diasporas: <i class="italic">victim</i> (e.g., African, Jewish, and Armenian), <i class="italic">imperial</i> (British), <i class="italic">labor</i> (Indian), <i class="italic">trade</i> (Chinese), and <i class="italic">cultural</i> (Caribbean). In certain cases, such as that of the Chinese, large-scale population movements have occurred on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Despite the diversity of forms, all diasporas share certain key features (Cohen, 1997):</p>
<ul class="contents">
<li class="bcpt"><span>a forced or voluntary movement from a homeland to a new region or regions</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>a shared memory about the homeland, a commitment to its preservation, and a belief in the possibility of eventual return</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>a strong ethnic identity sustained over time and distance</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>a sense of solidarity with members of the same ethnic group also living in areas of the diaspora</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>a degree of tension in relation to the host societies</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>the potential for valuable and creative contributions to pluralistic host societies</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some scholars have accused Cohen of simplifying complex and distinctive migration experiences into a narrow typology by associating categories of diasporas with particular ethnic groups. Others argue that his conceptualization of diaspora is not sufficiently precise. Yet Cohen’s study is valuable for demonstrating that diasporas are nonstatic, ongoing processes of maintaining collective identity and preserving ethnic culture in a rapidly globalizing world.</p>
