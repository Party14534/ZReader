<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">The Power Elite</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">C. Wright Mills’s celebrated work <i class="italic">The Power Elite</i> (1956) takes a view different from that of pluralist theories. According to Mills, early in its history, American society did show flexibility and diversity at all levels; however, this has since changed. Mills argued that during the twentieth century, a process of institutional centralization occurred in the political order, the economy, and the military. On the political side, individual state governments used to be very powerful and were loosely coordinated by the federal government. But by the mid-twentieth century, Mills argued, political power had become tightly coordinated at the federal level. Similarly, the economy once comprised many small units, businesses, banks, and farms, but now was dominated by a cluster of very large corporations. Finally, since World War II, the military, once restricted in size, had grown to a giant establishment at the heart of the country’s institutions.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Not only had each sphere become more centralized, according to Mills, but all had increasingly merged into a unified system of power. Those holding the highest positions in all three institutional areas had similar social backgrounds, enjoyed parallel interests, and often knew one another personally. They had become a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-power-elite" href="part0085_split_004.html#power-elite">power elite</a> that ran the country and, given the international position of the United States, influenced much of the rest of the world. Today, this elite group is sometimes called the “deep state”—entrenched government officials and bureaucrats, often linked to global business interests, who are unresponsive to the electorate, even in liberal democracies. Widespread dissatisfaction with governments considered unresponsive has fueled the rise of anti-government movements on both the right and left throughout the world, as we will discuss later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to Mills, the power elite is composed mainly of White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs) who are from wealthy families, attend the same prestigious universities, belong to the same clubs, and sit on government committees with one another. They have closely connected concerns. Business and political leaders work together, and both have close relationships with the military through weapons contracting and the supply of goods for the armed forces. There is considerable movement among top positions in the three spheres. Politicians have business interests; business leaders often run for public office; high-ranking military <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_465" title="465"></span>personnel sit on the boards of the large companies. The Trump cabinet, for example, included two former investment bankers (Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross), two from business (Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, since replaced by Mike Pompeo, and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos), and originally included two former U.S. Marine Corps generals (Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly) who have since been replaced by Defense Secretary Mark Esper (a top lobbyist for U.S. defense contractor Raytheon) and standing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. The net worth of the entire Trump administration is estimated at more than $12 billion, believed to be the highest in history (Martel, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In opposition to pluralist interpretations, Mills saw three distinct levels of power in the United States. The power elite occupies the highest level, formally and informally making key decisions affecting both domestic and foreign policy. Interest groups operate at the middle levels of power, together with local government agencies. Their influence over major policy decisions is limited. At the bottom is the mass of the population, who have virtually no influence on policy decisions because these are made within closed settings by the power elite. Because the power elite spans the top of both party organizations, the choices open to voters in presidential and congressional elections are so small as to be of little consequence.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Since Mills published his study, other researchers have analyzed the social background and interconnections of leading figures in American society. All studies find that the social backgrounds of those in leading positions are highly unrepresentative of the population as a whole (Domhoff, 1971, 1979, 1983, 1998, 2013).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The main argument among sociologists about the distribution of power in the United States now focuses on the relative power of government officials and of the business leaders who run large corporations. Some scholars argue that true power lies with politicians in government and that business leaders are much less powerful (Amenta, 1998; Orloff, 1993; Skocpol, 1992). Other scholars hold that corporate business executives and families of great wealth form a capitalist class that greatly influences government officials and experts through lobbying, campaign contributions, the sponsorship of think tanks, and the appointment of top corporate leaders to important government positions (Domhoff, 1998, 2013); some argue that a transnational capitalist class increasingly dominates national politics (Robinson, 2004, 2014). Both sides agree, however, that it is not inevitable for business leaders or government officials always to be dominant. Although an elite class—whether elected, expert, or corporate—rules America, the power of groups can change over time, leaving open the possibility that those who are now powerless could be dominant in the future.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">The Role of the Military</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Mills’s argument that the military plays a central role in the power elite was buttressed by a well-known warning from a former military hero and U.S. president, Dwight David Eisenhower. In his farewell address in 1961, Eisenhower warned, “In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_466" title="466"></span>whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist” (Eisenhower, 1961). Eisenhower’s experience lent considerable credence to his assertion: He served for eight years as president (1953–1961), held the top rank of five-star army general, and had been Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe during World War II. In 1989, at the end of the Cold War, U.S. defense spending—which had reached <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_467" title="467"></span>$300 billion in that year—began to decline slightly. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States became the world’s unrivaled military superpower; there was even talk of a “peace dividend” to spend on improving schools, repairing highways, or other domestic needs. But the decline proved to be short lived. The global war on terrorism triggered another cycle of military spending, which surpassed $700 billion in 2010 (Shah, 2011). U.S. military spending in 2019 was $732 billion (SIPRI, 2019). However, other studies estimate that the United States has spent $5.4 trillion on the war on terror as of 2020, and has over $1 trillion in obligations to veterans through 2059 (Crawford, 2019). Total military spending in the United States is greater than that for nearly all other countries in the world combined (see Figure 13.1). Eisenhower’s dire warning seems no less true today than when he uttered it half a century ago.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In societies with large populations, direct democracy (in which everybody participates in making policy) is not possible.

<td class="top">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the United States, two political parties (Democrat and Republican) dominate politics. The degree to which either represents the interest of the majority is often debated, and voter turnout tends to be lower than in other industrialized countries.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although direct democracy may not be possible in large-scale societies, it can be achieved nonetheless, since interest groups emerge that represent competing interests in society, such that each group ultimately has a voice that is heard. Examples of such competing interests are business organizations, trade unions, ethnic groups, environmental organizations, and religious groups.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">During the latter part of the twentieth century, big unions (such as the United Automobile Workers) were seen as countervailing powers against the economic might of companies like General Motors (then the world’s largest corporation).
