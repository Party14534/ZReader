<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Cultural and Social-Psychological Influences on Student Outcomes</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists are not only interested in the ways schools and socioeconomic factors affect children’s educational backgrounds; some are interested also in the ways cultural and psychological factors affect children’s educational opportunities and outcomes. These explanations are typically invoked to explain race and gender differences in students’ academic outcomes. In general, these theories propose that ethnic minorities and women are more likely than Whites and men to be socialized in a way that may disadvantage them in education (and in the workplace). Although race and gender disparities in many important educational outcomes have narrowed over the past half century, a number of gaps persist; sociologists are intent on figuring out why.</p>
<section id="race-and-the-acting-white-thesis">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Race and the “Acting White” Thesis</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Black and Latino students lag behind White and Asian students in their rates of graduating from high school. Yet even at younger ages, an achievement gap has been documented. For example, analyses by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in 2017 showed that Black and Hispanic students trailed their White peers by an average of more than 20 test-score points on the standardized math and reading assessments in the fourth and eighth grades, a difference of about two grade levels (NCES, 2019d). These achievement gaps persisted even though the score differentials between Black and White students narrowed between 1992 and 2007 in fourth-grade math and reading and eighth-grade math (NCES, 2009, 2011). Between 1992 and 2017, score differentials for reading assessments narrowed between Hispanic and White students, but the achievement gap remained constant between Black and White students. Meanwhile, scores in math assessment narrowed between Black and White students, yet remained constant between Hispanic and White students (NCES, 2019d). There are also significant racial achievement gaps in SAT scores: In 2018, the average scores on the math section for Blacks (463) and Hispanics (489) were significantly lower than the average score of Whites (557) (NCES, 2018e).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In attempting to explain these declining yet persistent racial achievement gaps in education, anthropologists John Ogbu and Signithia Fordham (1986) proposed the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-acting-white-thesis" href="part0105_split_006.html#acting-white-thesis">“acting White” thesis</a>. Based on ethnographic research of the educational experiences of Black students, Ogbu and Fordham concluded that the achievement gap can be partially explained by Black students’ reluctance to embrace school norms, which Black students associate with White culture. In subsequent years, however, a number of researchers have challenged the “acting White” thesis. For example, Roslyn Mickelson’s research (1990) on the achievement attitudes of African American students <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_630" title="630"></span>revealed that students held both <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-abstract-and-concrete-attitudes" href="part0105_split_006.html#abstract-and-concrete-attitudes">abstract and concrete attitudes</a> toward schooling. Their abstract attitudes were consistent with mainstream attitudes that placed a high value on education and the attainment of academic credentials for future success. However, these students also held concrete anti-achievement attitudes based on their experiences in school and their perception that they had few options in terms of entrance into higher education or lucrative careers even if they were to obtain a high school diploma.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">More recently, sociologist Prudence Carter’s study (2005) of the experiences of high school students in New York City revealed that Black and Latino students overwhelmingly believe in the importance of school and the need for educational credentials. Carter notes that Black and Latino students’ academic and social experiences are heterogeneous, and the most successful students are not necessarily the ones who assimilate to White, mainstream speech patterns, styles, and tastes. Instead, students whom she calls <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-cultural-navigators" href="part0105_split_006.html#cultural-navigators">cultural navigators</a>—those who draw from resources from both their home culture and the mainstream culture—tend to be highly successful in school. Ultimately, Carter argues, schools must promote intercultural communication and understanding to mitigate unequal academic outcomes.</p>

<section id="gender-and-achievement">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Gender and Achievement</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For many years, girls performed better on average than boys on standardized tests until they reached the middle years of secondary education. They then fell behind: Boys did better than girls, particularly in math and science. However, in recent years, we have seen a convergence and, in some cases, a reversal in the gender gap (College Board, 2016). In 2018, boys and girls scored roughly the same on the critical reading section of the SAT, while boys outpaced girls by 30 points on math (542 versus 522), and girls slightly outpaced boys on the writing component of the test (539 versus 534) (NCES, 2018e). Moreover, girls are more likely than boys to attend a four-year college immediately following high school graduation, and this gap is particularly pronounced among African Americans. For example, in 2017, 50.3 percent of girls who completed high school enrolled in a four-year school compared to 37.2 percent of boys (NCES, 2018c). Since the mid-1990s, a higher proportion of women than men have graduated from four-year colleges each year (Pollard, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Given this evidence, most scholars concur that today’s <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-gender-gap" href="part0105_split_006.html#gender-gap">gender gap</a> places girls ahead of boys. Sociologists have attempted to explain the reversal in the gender gap in a variety of ways. Some have argued that girls are doing better in schools today because the new service economy has created more opportunities for women, while factory jobs, traditionally a male terrain, have decreased in number because of new <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_631" title="631"></span>technologies and the relocation of manufacturing industries to developing countries. Other studies focus on the achievements made within the women’s movement and its effect on women’s self-esteem and expectations. Another important impact of the women’s movement is that teachers have become more aware of gender discrimination in the classroom and have taken steps to avoid gender stereotyping. Many teachers now incorporate learning materials that are free of gender bias, and they encourage girls to explore traditionally “male” subjects.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some sociologists today are wary of all the attention directed at underachieving boys. They contend that, although girls have forged ahead, they are still less likely than boys to choose subjects in school that lead to careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). In 2016, women accounted for 36 percent of degrees in STEM fields (NCES, 2019a). Boys pull away from girls by about age 11 in science and continue to outperform girls through college. And women continue to be disadvantaged in the job market despite the fact that they are entering college at higher rates than young men. The question of “Who fares worse, boys or girls?” will continue to challenge social scientists and educators in future generations as they strive to develop programs and policies to enhance gender equity.</p>

<section id="stereotype-threat-section">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Stereotype Threat</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Differential outcomes between White students and minority students and between girls and boys have also been explained in social psychological terms. Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson’s influential work (Steele and Aronson, 1995, 2004) on <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-stereotype-threat" href="part0105_split_006.html#stereotype-threat">stereotype threat</a> suggests that when African American students (or female students) believe they are being judged not as individuals but as members of a negatively stereotyped social group, they will do worse on tests. Conversely, students who believe they are judged as members of a positively stereotyped group have been found to do better on tests. Sociologist Jennifer Lee refers to this as <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-stereotype-promise" href="part0105_split_006.html#stereotype-promise">stereotype promise</a>, a phenomenon she detected among Asian American students. The Chinese American and Vietnamese American students she tracked talked about how their teachers assumed that they were smart, hard-working achievers. These perceptions affected the way their teachers treated them, the grades they received, and their chances of securing slots in their schools’ most competitive programs, like AP classes (Lee and Zhou, 2014).</p>
