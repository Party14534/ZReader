<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Race and the Criminal Justice System</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Much contemporary research on crime and deviance has focused on the relationship between race and the American criminal justice system. Today, many sociologists are interested in the ways we try to control, police, and punish deviant behavior—and how our legal system disproportionately punishes individuals of color—in particular, African American men.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Think back to our earlier discussion of the Italian American Mafia. In a later study titled <i class="italic">Black Mafia</i> (1974), Francis Ianni found that as Italian Mafia members moved out of crime and into the American mainstream, organized crime persisted—with new ethnic groups arriving to take control of former Mafia enterprises. Ianni considers whether this process of “ethnic succession” will occur in the case of Black and Puerto Rican Americans, allowing them to take on the mafiosi mantle in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Like members of the Italian American Mafia, new members of the Black Mafia sought to lead respectable lives and escape urban poverty through illegal means. Ianni’s analysis asks whether, over time, the Black Mafia “can also follow the pattern of Italians and use these same monies as a basis for movement into legitimate areas” (Gladwell, 2014: 319). Ultimately, Ianni found that the Black Mafia faced unique constraints in expanding its criminal organization beyond the ghetto and amassing sufficient wealth to reinvest in the legitimate economy. First, the Black Mafia became overly dependent on the drug trade and was unable to diversify its criminal activities in the same way as the Italian Mafia had done. The drug trade upon which they depended would later receive extraordinary scrutiny and punitive action from the federal government and law enforcement officials. Second, they were never able to develop the kinds of relations with White politicians that once contributed to the stability of White organized crime.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, rates of mass incarceration linked to the drug trade have reached historic peaks. Police increasingly rely on new surveillance techniques to control crime and the drug trade in urban ghettos, which causes young Black men to lead lives as fugitives “on the run” (Goffman, 2014; see <a href="part0015_split_000.html#E9OE0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 2</a>). While organized crime may have provided a pathway “up and out” for Italian Americans, it seems to have had the opposite effect for Black Americans (Ianni, 1974). Both historically and today, we see how race interacts with our criminal justice system to allow some deviants to enter mainstream society while cutting off those same pathways for others.</p>
