<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Before we explore the origins of differences between men and women, boys and girls, it is important that we define and differentiate those attributes and processes that make us male or female. One critical distinction is between sex and gender. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-sex" href="part0066_split_005.html#sex">Sex</a> refers to physical differences of the body, whereas <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-gender" href="part0066_split_005.html#gender">gender</a> concerns the psychological, social, and cultural differences between males and females, such as personality, goals, and social roles. The distinction between sex and gender is fundamental because many of the most important differences between males and females are not biological. While sex is something we are born with, gender is something that we both learn and do. Sex and gender historically have been viewed as a binary, meaning the two categories of male and female, or masculine and feminine, are seen as distinctive and nonoverlapping—even opposing (Lorber, 1996). However, as we shall soon see, sex and gender can be fuzzy and overlapping categories, and the boundaries demarcating “male” and “female” behaviors, traits, and even bodies are fluid and evolving.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-gender-role-socialization" href="part0066_split_005.html#gender-role-socialization">Gender role socialization</a> is the process through which we learn about male- and female-typed roles and practices from socializing agents such as the family, peers, schools, and the media (as discussed in <a href="part0028_split_000.html#QMFO0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 4</a>). For example, boys may learn how to engage in rambunctious and aggressive play by watching their favorite male superheroes on TV, while young girls may learn how to nurture their younger siblings by following the model set by their mothers or grandmothers. Through contact with primary and secondary agents of socialization, children internalize the social norms and expectations that correspond with their sex. Gender differences are not biologically determined; they are culturally produced.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We also learn how to “do” gender in our daily interactions with others (West and Zimmerman, 1987). Our clothing choices, how we wear our hair, even the pitch and intonation of our voice are all indications of how we “do gender” each day. This process of doing gender underscores the notion that gender is “socially constructed.” Theorists who believe in the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-construction-of-gender" href="part0066_split_005.html#social-construction-of-gender">social construction of gender</a> reject biological bases for gender differences. Gender identities emerge, they argue, in relation to perceived sex differences in societies and cultures, which in turn shape and even perpetuate those differences. For example, a society in which cultural ideas of masculinity are characterized by physical strength and tough attitudes will encourage men to <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_329" title="329"></span>cultivate a specific body image and set of mannerisms (Butler, 1989; Connell, 1987; Scott and Morgan, 1993). Men who fail to comply with what scholars call “<a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-hegemonic" href="part0066_split_005.html#hegemonic">hegemonic masculinity</a>”—the social norms dictating that men should be strong, self-reliant, and unemotional—may be subtly sanctioned for not enacting gender roles in a way that is consistent with prevailing cultural norms (Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005). We will elaborate on these four concepts—sex, gender, gender role socialization, and social construction of gender—in the following sections. As you will soon see, our identities as “male” or “female” are not as simple as they seem.</p>
