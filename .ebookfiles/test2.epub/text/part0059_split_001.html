<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">If you went out on a limb and guessed Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Bernard Arnault—someone you most likely have never heard of—you were right! Even though most Americans have never heard of the French billionaire Bernard Arnault, in March 2020, he ranked third, with a net worth (the value of everything he owned minus everything he owed) of $76 billion. Bezos got top billing, with a net worth of $113 billion; Gates was not far behind with a net worth of $98 billion (Dolan, 2020). While the sources of Bezos’s wealth (Amazon) and Gates’s wealth (Microsoft) are known by just about everyone, “LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton”—a giant corporation that is the world’s largest maker of luxury goods—is hardly a household phrase. Among the products that propelled Arnault to third place: Louis Vuitton goods (you can pick up a pair of men’s V.N.R. Sneakers for a mere $1,190; women’s Denim Monogram Check Dresses go for only $2,250); TAG Heuer watches (prices range from $1,000 to $74,750); and Dom Perignon champagne (a bargain at $150 a bottle; a rare vintage once fetched the staggering sum of $84,700!).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The fortunes of these three men illustrate some important themes that will be developed throughout this chapter. Bezos’s wealth stems from the retail revolution he launched—online shopping combined with home delivery. Amazon has made consumption virtually effortless, and now employs three-quarters of a million workers. It has also put many stores (along with the jobs they provided) out of business.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Amazon’s success was made possible, in part, by Microsoft; Gates’s computer/Windows software company played a major role in paving the way for today’s virtual world, in which we can now engage in impulse buying on our smartphones or computers. Arnault, however, is a relative newcomer to the top tier of the world’s richest people. While there have always been wealthy consumers (that $84,700 bottle of Dom Perignon champagne was sold at a New York City wine auction in 1959), there are now far more superrich in the world today than ever before in human history. Their wealth has made the sale of luxury goods, from private jets and yachts to $75,000 watches, a highly profitable business <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_287" title="287"></span>for Arnault and others. The computer and retail revolutions, launched by Gates, Bezos, and other entrepreneurs, are a part of the story. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-globalization" href="part0059_split_002.html#globalization">Globalization</a>—the increased economic, political, and social interconnectedness of the world—is another.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Over the past several decades, globalization has produced a skyrocketing number of billionaires. When Forbes first started keeping a list in 1987, it could identify only 140 billionaires throughout the world (Kilachand, 2012). By 2020, the most recent year for which Forbes has data, there were 2,095 billionaires, with a combined net worth of $8.0 trillion (Dolan, 2020). It should be noted that by March 2020 the world economy had already begun to slow as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Billionaires weren’t immune to the pandemic’s financial effects: one year earlier, in March 2019, the world’s billionaires were worth $8.7 trillion. Of these billionaires, 614 (29 percent) were from the United States, while China came in second with 389 billionaires (19 percent) (Dolan, 2020). While the United States still has the world’s largest economy (China is rapidly closing in), the “rise of the rest” has brought great wealth to a growing number of people in other countries (Zakaria, 2009).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As globalization has created a growing number of billionaires, it has also resulted in growing inequality. The world’s 2,095 billionaires could easily fit into a large lecture hall or movie theater. Despite accounting for an insignificant fraction of the world’s 7.7 billion people, they own 2.0 percent of the world’s wealth (the world’s wealth is estimated at $361 trillion) (Shorrocks et al., 2019b). If we extend our lens beyond billionaires, to look at the richest 1 percent of the world’s population, it turns out that the top 1 percent possesses almost as much of the world’s wealth (45 percent) as the remaining 99 percent (Shorrocks et al., 2019b). The United States, by itself, accounts for 29 percent of the world’s wealth (Figure 9.1) (Shorrocks et al., 2019b); yet within the United States, vast inequality also exists. According to Federal Reserve data, the richest 1 percent of U.S. households accounted for 32 percent of all the wealth in the country in 2019 (<i class="italic">US News</i>, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Globalization has produced opportunities for unthinkable wealth but also widespread poverty and suffering. Consider Mossammat Rebecca Khatun, a young woman who sewed clothing in the Rana Plaza industrial building in Bangladesh, often laboring 13 hours a day, six days a week, for weekly earnings unlikely to exceed $11. Rebecca, and thousands like her, made clothing for major European and U.S. brands and retailers. When Rana Plaza collapsed on April 24, 2013, 1,137 people died and thousands were injured. Rebecca was one of the lucky ones: She survived, buried alive for two days before rescuers reached her. But she lost her right foot and her entire left leg, and she still suffers from constant pain. Rebecca’s mother, who worked in the same building, was not so fortunate: Her body was never found (Parveen, 2014). Billions of workers such as Rebecca are being drawn into the global labor force, many working in oppressive and unsafe conditions that would be unacceptable, if not unimaginable, under U.S. labor laws. And these are the fortunate ones. Those outside the global economy are frequently even worse off.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the previous chapter, we noted vast differences in individuals’ income, wealth, work, and quality of life. Just as we can speak of rich or poor individuals within a country, we can also talk about rich or poor countries within the world system. A country’s position in the global economy affects how its people live, work, and die. In this chapter, we examine the differences in wealth and power among countries in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. We examine differences in economic standards of living and then turn to a discussion of different theories on the causes of global inequality and what can be done about it. We conclude by considering some unanswered questions concerning economic inequality in an age of globalization. As <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_289" title="289"></span>we will see throughout this chapter, globalization has produced great wealth—as well as great inequality—both between and within countries.</p>
