<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One widely used qualitative method is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-ethnography" href="part0018_split_007.html#ethnography">ethnography</a>, or firsthand studies of people using observations, interviews, or both. Here, the investigator socializes, works, or lives with members of a group, organization, or community. In the case of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-participant-observation" href="part0018_split_007.html#participant-observation">participant observation</a>, the researcher participates directly in the activities he or she is studying. Other ethnographers, by contrast, may <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_39" title="39"></span>observe at a distance and not participate directly in the activities under observation. An ethnographer cannot simply be present in the group she studies but must explain and justify her presence to its members. The researcher must gain and sustain the cooperation of the community to achieve worthwhile results.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For a long while, research based on participant observation excluded accounts of the hazards or problems involved, but more recently, fieldworkers have been more open. Frequently, fieldworkers experience feelings of loneliness and frustration, the latter occurring especially when group members refuse to talk frankly with them. Some types of fieldwork may be physically dangerous; for instance, a researcher studying a delinquent gang might be seen as a police informer or might become unwittingly embroiled in conflicts with rival gangs.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In traditional works of ethnography, accounts provided little information about the observer because ethnographers were expected to present objective reports. More recently, ethnographers have increasingly spoken about their connection to the people under study. For example, a researcher might discuss how her race, class, or gender affected the work, or how the power differences between observer and observed distorted the dialogue between them.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Advantages and Limitations of Fieldwork</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Successful ethnography provides rich information on the behavior of people in groups, organizations, and communities, as well as information on how these people understand their own behavior. Once we look inside a given group, we can better understand not only that group but also broader social processes.</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">But fieldwork has its limitations. Only fairly small groups or communities can be studied. Much also depends on the researcher’s skill in gaining the confidence of the individuals involved. Also, a researcher could identify so closely with the group that he loses the perspective of an objective outside observer. Or a researcher might draw conclusions that are more about his own effect on the situation than he or his readers realize. Interpreting ethnographies usually involves problems of generalizability because we cannot be sure that what we find in one context will apply in others, or even that two different researchers will draw the same conclusions when studying the same group.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">A Recent Example of an Ethnography</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When Alice Goffman was a graduate student, she spent six years in an intensely policed poor Black neighborhood. She was interested in the social situation of large numbers of Black men who were on the run from the criminal justice system. She became part of the everyday life of a group of boys who were known as the 6th Street Boys, writing about them in her book <i class="italic">On the Run</i> (Goffman, 2014). Goffman’s research cast new light on the struggles of men who were dipping and dodging the police and worrying that any encounter would result in their imprisonment. By spending time with them every day for many years, Goffman was able to see that for these men, activities, relations, and localities that others relied on to maintain a decent and respectable identity were transformed into a system that authorities used to locate, arrest, and confine them. The police and the courts became dangerous to interact with, as did showing up to work or going to places such as hospitals. Instead of a safe place to sleep, eat, and find acceptance and support, their childhood homes were transformed into a “last known address,” one of the first places police looked for them. Close relatives, friends, and neighbors became potential informants.</p>
