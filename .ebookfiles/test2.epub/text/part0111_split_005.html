<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_5">Gender and Religion</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Like other social institutions, churches and denominations have, on the whole, excluded women from power. The following sections examine some of the interrelations of religion and gender. This is an area in which significant changes are occurring.</p>
<section id="religious-images">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Religious Images</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In Christianity, although Mary, the mother of Jesus, is sometimes treated as having divine qualities, God is “the Father,” a male figure, and Jesus took the human shape of a man. Genesis, the first book of the Bible, teaches that woman was created from a man’s rib. These facts have not gone unnoticed by women’s movements. Over a hundred years ago, Elizabeth Cady Stanton published a series of commentaries on the Scriptures, titled <i class="italic">The Woman’s Bible.</i> In her view, the deity had created women and men as beings of equal value, and the Bible should fully reflect this fact. The “masculinist” character of the Bible reflected the fact that it was written by men. In 1870, the Church of England established a Revision Committee to revise and update the biblical texts, but the committee contained no women. Stanton asserted that there was no reason to suppose that God is a man, because it was clear in the Scriptures that all human beings were fashioned in the image of God. She subsequently organized the Women’s Revision Committee in America, composed of 23 women, to advise her in preparing <i class="italic">The Woman’s Bible,</i> which was published in 1895.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In some Buddhist orders, especially Mahayana Buddhism, women are represented in a favorable light. But, on the whole, Buddhism is “an overwhelmingly male-created institution dominated by a patriarchal power structure,” in which the feminine is mostly “associated with the secular, powerless, profane, and imperfect” (Paul, 1985). The contrasting pictures of women that appear in Buddhist texts no doubt mirror the ambiguous attitudes of men toward women in the secular world: Women are portrayed as wise, maternal, and gentle, yet also as mysterious, polluting, and destructive, threatening evil.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">The Role of Women in Religious Organizations</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In both Buddhism and (later) Christianity, women were allowed to express strong religious convictions by becoming nuns. Although the first orders for women were probably established in the twelfth century, their membership remained small until the 1800s. At that time, many women took religious vows to become teachers and nurses because these occupations were largely controlled by the religious orders. Nonetheless, female religious orders remained subject to a male hierarchy, and elaborate rituals reinforced this subjugation. For example, all nuns were regarded as “brides of Christ.” Until some orders made changes in the 1950s and 1960s, “marriage” ceremonies were carried out, during which the novice would cut her hair, receive her religious name, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_685" title="685"></span>and sometimes be given a wedding ring. After several years, a novice would take a vow of perpetual profession, after which she was required to receive dispensation if she chose to leave.</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Women’s orders today show considerable diversity. In some convents, nuns still dress in traditional habits and live in communities removed from the secular world. In other convents, nuns wear ordinary dress and live in apartments or houses. Traditional restrictions, such as not talking to others during certain periods of the day or walking with hands folded and hidden under the habit, are rarely evident.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Despite such liberalization, women have filled only lower-status positions in religious organizations. This situation is changing, in line with changes affecting women in society generally. In recent years, women’s groups have pressed for equal status in religious orders. Increasingly, the Catholic and Episcopalian churches are under strong pressure to allow women an equal voice in their hierarchies. Yet in 1977, the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in Rome declared that women could not be admitted to the Catholic priesthood; the reason was that Jesus had not called a woman to be one of his disciples. Ten years later, 1987 was officially designated the “Year of the Madonna,” during which the Congregation advised women to recall their traditional role as wives and mothers.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The barriers to Catholic women in the hierarchy of the church thus remain formidable. In a letter published in May 1994, Pope John Paul II reaffirmed the Roman Catholic Church’s ban on the ordination of women. And in July 2010, in response to widely publicized scandals involving priests who had sexually abused children, the Vatican strengthened its rules on such abuses, characterizing them as “grave crimes”—but the same decree also extended the list of “grave crimes” to include any priest who ordained a woman. Catholic organizations that favored the ordination of women priests complained that the decree implied that female ordination and pedophilia were equally grave offenses (Bates, 2010; Catholic Women’s Ordination, 2010).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Episcopal Church has allowed women into its priesthood since 1976. Altogether, women have been ordained as ministers in about half the Protestant denominations in the United States, including the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and the United Methodist Church. And, except within Orthodox Judaism, women in the United States can become rabbis as well.</p>

<section id="women-and-islam">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Women and Islam</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Despite the resurgence of traditional Islamist views in some parts of the Muslim world in recent years, Muslim women in most countries continue to experience a high degree of freedom and equality. As noted in <a href="part0083_split_000.html#2F4UM0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 13</a>, women have served as heads of state in such predominantly Muslim nations as Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Turkey. The first person to found a university was reportedly a Muslim woman, Fatima al-Fihri, who founded a Moroccan university in the ninth century. In Afghanistan, before the militant Islamic nationalists known as the Taliban took over in 1996, women played prominent roles: Shafiqa Habibi was the country’s most popular television news anchor, her face (uncovered) known throughout the country. During the Taliban’s rule, she spent her time at home, hidden from public view. When she ventured out, her body had to be covered by a <i class="italic">burka</i>, a traditional tentlike garment with a screen sewn into the fabric over her face to hide her eyes but allow some ability to see (Filkins, 1998).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Habibi’s experience was shared by all Afghan women. The Taliban’s extreme Islamic beliefs forbade women from working outside the home, attending school, or appearing in public without covering their bodies from head to toe. Women seen in public with any man who was not their husband or relative were brutally beaten or killed. Since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, women have begun to regain their rights in Afghanistan, at least in the capital city of Kabul. But throughout much of the rest of the country, local religious leaders, including the Taliban, have begun to make a comeback, and women are afraid to exercise their legal rights for fear of retribution.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There is a debate among Muslim scholars as to whether Islam in fact requires severe restrictions on the role of women. At one extreme, the highly conservative interpretation sometimes known as Wahhabism (after the name of its nineteenth-century founder) has led to the severe treatment of women practiced by the Taliban. This strict version of Islam is strongly practiced in oil-rich Saudi Arabia, which has funded <i class="italic">madrassa</i>s (“schools”) throughout the Muslim world, where Wahhabism is taught. A more moderate view of women’s roles—which still calls for restrictions such as veiling—was advanced by the prominent Iranian philosopher Ali Shariati. In his view, women should be veiled both because this reflects the chastity and piety of Muhammad’s daughter Fatima, and because it represents defiance of the Western view of women (Aslan, 2006; Shariati, 1971). Many Muslim women voluntarily choose to veil themselves, out of religious belief or as a cultural rejection of Western attitudes toward what is proper for women; a feminist case for wearing the veil can also be made (Francois-Cerrah, 2014; Elver, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A feminist view is offered by Amina Wadud in her book <i class="italic">Qur’an and Woman: Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman’s Perspective</i> (1999). Wadud argues that women’s inferior status in some Muslim-majority countries results partly from Islam’s seventh-century Arabian origins, when women were relegated to an inferior status, and partly from the hostility toward women that has characterized centuries of male-centered interpretations of the Qur’an. Reza Aslan (2006), an Iranian-born American sociologist who has written extensively on Islam, states the feminist position succinctly:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As Shirin Ebadi proudly declared while accepting the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize for her tireless work in defending the rights of women in Iran, “God created us all as equals. . . . By fighting for equal status, we are doing what God <i class="italic">wants</i> us to do.” . . . <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_687" title="687"></span>The so-called Muslim women’s movement is predicated on the idea that Muslim men, not Islam, have been responsible for the suppression of women’s rights. For this reason, Muslim feminists throughout the world are advocating a return to the society Muhammad originally envisioned for his followers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Bible, like the Qur’an, provides a range of moral teachings, many in conflict with one another, that were rooted in the moral beliefs of the time. Some of these teachings would be regarded by most Christians and Jews today as completely unacceptable. Examples include:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">“If . . . no proof of the girl’s virginity can be found, she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death.” (Deuteronomy 22:20–21)</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">“Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.” (1 Corinthians 14:34)</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">“I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence.” (Timothy 2:12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">From a sociological perspective, it is important to ask not only how such beliefs arose a thousand or more years ago, but also how they are being interpreted today—and how these interpretations find their way into new religious movements and social practices.</p>
