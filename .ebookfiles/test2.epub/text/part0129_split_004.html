<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">Whose View Is Most Nearly Correct?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are elements of truth in all three views, although those of the transformationalists are perhaps the most balanced. The skeptics underestimate how much the world is changing; world finance markets, for example, are organized on a global level much more than ever before. Yet, at the same time, the world has undergone periods of globalization before—only to withdraw into periods when countries protected their markets and closed their borders to trade. Although the march of globalization seems inevitable, it may not continue unabated: Countries that find themselves losing out may attempt to stem the tide, as indicated by Brexit as well as recent elections in Germany, Poland, and the United States.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">On the one hand, the hyperglobalizers are correct in pointing to the current strength of globalization as dissolving many national barriers, changing the nature of state power, and creating powerful transnational social classes. On the other hand, they often see globalization too much in economic terms and too much as a one-way process. In reality, globalization is much more complex. World-systems theorists such as Immanuel Wallerstein (2004) and Giovanni Arrighi (1994) argue that while countries remain important actors on the global field, so, too, are transnational corporations. National governments will neither dissolve under the weight of a globalized <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_830" title="830"></span>economy (as some hyperglobalizers argue) nor reassert themselves as the dominant political force (as some skeptics argue), but rather will seek to steer global capitalism to their own advantage. The world economy of the future may be much more globalized than today’s, with multinational corporations and global institutions playing increasingly important roles. But some countries in the world economy may still be more powerful than even the most powerful transnational actors.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The world is in the midst of a highly dynamic and turbulent transformation. It is not surprising, perhaps, that scholars cannot agree on the social forces that are reshaping it.</p>
