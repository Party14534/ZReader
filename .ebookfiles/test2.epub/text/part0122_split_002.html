<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Dynamics of Population Change</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-rates-of-population-growth-or-decline" href="part0122_split_003.html#rates-of-population-growth-or-decline">Rates of population growth or decline</a> are measured by subtracting the yearly number of deaths per 1,000 from the number of births per 1,000. (Actual population growth or decline also requires taking into account the number of people who have migrated into the country, as well as the number who have emigrated out of the country.) For the world as a whole, population is increasing 1.1 percent each year, which is half the rate of fifty years ago (World Bank, 2019j). While this trend is certainly promising—the population explosion is clearly slowing—as we have seen it will still result in several billion more people by the end of the century, if the predicted trends prove to be correct.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">How can such a tiny rate of growth (1.1 percent each year) produce billions of more people over the next seventy or so years? The answer is that population growth is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-exponential" href="part0122_split_003.html#exponential">exponential</a>: People born today add to the total population, creating a larger base for future growth. Since today there are approximately 7.7 billion people in the world, and the annual growth rate is currently 1.1 percent, then next year there will be 84.7 million more people (7,700,000,000 <span>×</span> 1.1 percent 5 84,700,000), bringing the total to 7,784,700,000. If this larger population base continues to grow at 1.1 percent each year, then two years from now 85,631,700 more people will be added, and so on into the future. Each year, the number of people added will grow. We can measure this effect by means of the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-doubling-time" href="part0122_split_003.html#doubling-time">doubling time</a>—the period of time it takes for the population to double. The formula used to calculate doubling time is 70 divided by the current growth rate. For example, a population growth of 1 percent will produce a doubling of numbers in 70 years. At 2 percent growth, a population will double in 35 years, while at 3 percent, it will double in 23 years.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Virtually all industrialized countries have growth rates of less than 0.6 percent. For example, the rate of population growth for the European Union in 2018 was only 0.2 percent (doubling in 350 years); for the United States, 0.6 percent (doubling in 117 years). While some countries have experienced population decline because of war or economic collapse (Syria and Venezuela are current examples), this also is true of such advanced industrial countries as Japan, Portugal and Italy (all –0.2 percent) (World Bank, 2019j). In these countries, fertility has declined relative to mortality sufficiently that births (and net migration) no longer outnumber deaths. As we shall see, economic success appears to go hand-in-hand with declining population growth (and, at the extreme, even population decline).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">On the other hand, as previously noted, the poorest countries in the world have the highest crude birth rates and therefore the fastest-growing populations. The number of people in low-income countries grew 2.6 percent in 2018, meaning their <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_767" title="767"></span>populations will double in only 27 years (World Bank, 2019j). High birth rates also mean a youthful population: 42 percent of people living in low-income countries are under 14, compared with only 17 percent in high-income countries. In Niger, the world’s “youngest country,” fully half the population is under 14 (World Bank, 2019h). A young, poor population creates numerous social and economic challenges: Educational opportunities are often nonexistent, and many children must work full time, while others eke out a living as street children, begging for whatever they can. Large numbers of unemployed or underemployed young people, especially young men, are often a prescription for unrest, providing a recruiting ground for organizations that advocate for radical (and sometimes violent) change (Darden, 2019).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While poor countries consume far less than rich countries (and in that sense have less of an environmental impact), their more rapidly growing populations require additional resources. And to the extent that they successfully industrialize and improve their living standards, their environmental impacts will only increase, at least in the short run (in the long run, successful industrialization may also result in slower population growth).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">The Demographic Transition</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">During the nineteenth century, successful industrialization and economic development in Europe and the United States did in fact result in slower population growth. This has been termed the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-demographic-transition" href="part0122_split_003.html#demographic-transition">demographic transition</a>, a notion first worked out by <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_768" title="768"></span>Warren S. Thompson (1929), who described a three-stage process in which one type of population stability would eventually be replaced by another, as a society reached an advanced level of economic development.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">Stage one</i> refers to the conditions characteristic of most pre-industrial societies, in which both birthrates and death rates are high and the infant mortality rate is especially high. Population grows little, if at all, as the high number of births is more or less offset by the large number of deaths. Although there were sometimes periods of marked population increase, these were followed by increases in death rates.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">Stage two</i>, which began with industrial development in Europe and the United States in the early part of the nineteenth century (with wide regional variations), occurs when death rates fall while fertility remains high. The death rates fell because of improved agriculture, resulting in more stable food supplies, as well as some advances in public health (such as water supplies, sewage and sanitation controls, and the growth of medical knowledge). Fertility initially remains high, however, because of cultural lag—long-standing beliefs and practices that supported having large families were slow to change. This was, therefore, a phase of marked population growth. (Some scholars divide this stage into two phases, one in which birth rates remain high but death rates drop, and a second in which death rates also begin to decline).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">Stage three</i> occurs when cultural norms change from favoring high birthrates to instead favoring low birthrates. Once again, birthrates and death rates are aligned—this time both at low levels. Once again, population is stable. This transition is partly the result of the changing economics of having many children. As economies transitioned from agricultural to industrial, parents no longer required many children to help maintain their farms, although at least initially children could work in factories. But as industrial economies matured, child labor was made illegal; instead, compulsory schooling meant that parents were expected to support their children throughout their school years—and sometimes even throughout their college years. Instead of being seen as an economic asset, children came to be viewed as an economic cost. Parents became increasingly concerned with “child quality” and providing resources to ensure the best possible life for their offspring, rather than “child quantity,” or having many children.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Industrial development also was accompanied by technologies that allowed women to control their own fertility, as well as a cultural change regarding people’s views toward childbearing. How many children a woman would have was now viewed as under her own control, rather than as a “gift from God.” In contemporary society, as women have achieved higher levels of education and higher earnings in the labor market, the incentive to have fewer children has increased. Higher education among both men and women also is linked to delayed marriage and, consequently, delayed (and thus diminished) childbearing (Caldwell et al., 2010).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Demographers do not fully agree about how to interpret this sequence of change or how long-lasting stage three is likely to be. Fertility in the Western countries has not been completely stable over the past century or so; considerable differences in fertility remain among the industrialized nations, and among classes or regions within them. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_769" title="769"></span>Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that this sequence accurately describes a major transformation in the demographic character of modern societies.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In recent decades, demographers have debated whether a “<a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-second-demographic-transition" href="part0122_split_003.html#second-demographic-transition">second demographic transition</a>” has begun in the most developed industrial countries. Under this new model, fertility rates continue to fall because of shifts in family structure. Key influences on the second demographic transition include delayed marriage, delayed childbearing, rising rates of cohabitation, high, steady rates of divorce, and the relative ease of obtaining effective means of birth control. All of these factors arguably lead to lower birthrates, because under these circumstances many people may prefer not to have children (van de Kaa, 2003). This may account for the extremely low birthrates among advanced industrial societies. In fact, as we have previously seen, some appear to have moved into a fourth stage, in which birthrates decline below replacement levels; that is, mortality rates (which remain low) outstrip fertility rates (which drop even lower than mortality rates), resulting in population decline.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The shift to still lower birthrates, and even population decline, has been the recent experience of many European countries as well as Japan and Singapore. A process of aging has resulted, in which the proportion of young people declines while the proportion of the elderly markedly increases. If this trend continues, it can have widespread economic and social implications for economically developed countries. First, there will be an increase in the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-dependency-ratio" href="part0122_split_003.html#dependency-ratio">dependency ratio</a>, the ratio of economically dependent members (the older population) to economically productive members (younger working members) of the population. Economically dependent persons are those considered too young or too old to work, typically those under age 15 and over age 65. As the dependency ratio increases, pressure will mount on health care and social services—with relatively fewer persons working (and therefore able to pay the taxes) needed to finance them.</p>
