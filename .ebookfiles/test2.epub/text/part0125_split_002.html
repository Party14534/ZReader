<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Sustainable Development, or Adaptation to the Inevitable?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we have seen, sustainable development requires governments to take immediate actions to reduce their countries’ carbon emissions, in part by switching to more renewable forms of energy, commitments that are reflected in the Paris Agreements. Apart from state-led efforts, many environmental advocates argue that if global ecological disaster is to be avoided, people in rich countries should consume more sustainably: recycle, carpool, use public transportation, buy fewer items. Consumers are urged to buy eco-friendly products, which is now possible since virtually all major corporations claim to be fully committed to ecological sustainability. To take but two examples, Walmart, whose revenues make it the world’s largest corporation, promises over the next 5 to 10 years to have reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by a billion metric tons while deriving half of its energy from renewable sources (Walmart, 2019). The Sustainable Apparel Coalition comprises more than a hundred major apparel, footwear, and textile companies that promise “no unnecessary environmental harm” in manufacturing their products. To achieve this goal, the member firms self-report environmental and workplace conditions throughout their supply chains, which are then compiled into a sustainability index (SAC, 2019; Kibbey, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Critics counter that while government and individual sustainable development efforts are laudable and should be pursued, by themselves they are unlikely to solve our climate problems. They point out that whatever governments may have agreed to in Paris, in fact fossil fuel production remains heavily subsidized and has actually increased in recent years. In terms of individual actions, critics claim that eco-friendly shopping is certainly a worthy goal that may make a small difference, but in terms of significantly affecting climate change is unlikely to be effective unless billions of people join in. Furthermore, they argue, it relies on businesses to truthfully report their ecological impacts—claims that must be treated skeptically, since such claims are almost never independently verified. Business efforts to trumpet their sustainability are seen as all too often a form of “greenwashing,” an effort to boost sales by convincing consumers that the products they buy are eco-friendly (Appelbaum, 2016; Appelbaum and Lichtenstein, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because some amount of global warming seems inevitable, the recent IPCC report emphasized measures that might be taken to offset some of the predicted consequences. These included recommendations for such things as early warning systems, flood and cyclone shelters, sea walls and levees, desalinization plants to convert sea water to drinking water, and programs to educate people about the dangers of global warming. But will such actions prove sufficient? In the view of some scientists, even with such limited measures, rising temperatures and associated destructive climate events are inevitable, unless truly drastic steps are taken. Another, more drastic solution is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-geoengineering" href="part0125_split_003.html#geoengineering">geoengineering</a>, large-scale interventions in the earth’s natural systems to counteract climate change. Some geoengineering proposals are global in scope, but do not seek to dramatically alter existing ecosystems—for example, massive reforestation to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_813" title="813"></span>proposals involve novel interventions with unknown long-term ecological effects: building giant “space mirrors” or releasing reflective particles in the upper atmosphere to deflect the warming rays of the sun; converting seawater into droplets that can be used to seed clouds and increase cloud cover; building huge machines to remove and bury atmospheric carbon dioxide; seeding the ocean with nutrients that will grow plants that absorb carbon dioxide (Oxford Engineering Programme, 2019; Pierce, 2019). Critics worry that such large-scale efforts to re-engineer the earth’s ocean, land, and atmosphere may divert attention from the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while potentially resulting in disastrous ecological consequences (NAS, 2015; Vaughan, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One final approach involves simply accepting the inevitability of climate change and learning to live with it. According to this view, climate-induced social collapse is inevitable, requiring a <i class="italic">deep adaptation agenda</i> in response. Such an agenda has three components: recognizing that individuals and societies have proven remarkably resilient in bouncing back from trauma and disaster, so things will eventually work themselves out; letting go of past expectations about the possibility of endless but sustainable growth; and adapting to the “new normal” by rediscovering a simpler way of life—the beliefs and lifestyles that preceded our current carbon-driven economies. The new lifestyle involves such things as restoring the original wildland environments; dieting with locally produced seasonal foods, rather than importing food grown half a world away; and replacing our electronically-mediated forms of virtual interaction with a return to actual face-to-face local communities. Deep adaptation will clearly be psychologically and spiritually challenging for many, since it means adapting to a very different world than the one most of us were born into (Slater and Bendel, 2019; Verlie, 2019).</p>
