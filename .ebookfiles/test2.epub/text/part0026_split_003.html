<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Does Globalization Weaken or Strengthen Local Cultures?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The world has become a single social system as a result of growing ties of interdependence, both social and economic, that affect everyone. But it would be a mistake to think of increasing globalization simply as the growth of world unity. Rather, it is primarily the reordering of time and distance in social life as our lives are increasingly influenced by events far removed from our everyday activities.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Globalizing processes have brought many benefits to Americans, such as a much greater variety of goods and foodstuffs. At the same time, those processes have helped create some of the most serious problems American society faces, such as global climate change, the threat of terrorism, and the loss of jobs to low-wage workers in other countries.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The growing global culture has provoked numerous reactions at the local level. Many local cultures remain strong or are experiencing rejuvenation, partly out of the concern that a global culture, dominated by North American and European cultural values, will corrupt the local culture. For example, extremist Islamist movements in Afghanistan, in the tribal areas of Pakistan, in Yemen, and elsewhere in the Middle East seek to impose traditional tribal values, often prohibiting the consumption of alcohol, requiring men to grow full beards, and forbidding women from working outside their homes or being seen in public with men who are not their spouses or relatives. In some cases, violations of these rules are punished, sometimes by death. These movements can be understood partly as a rejection of the spread of Western culture—what Osama bin Laden referred to as “Westoxification” (Juergensmeyer, 2001).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The resurgence of local cultures is evident in the rise of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-nationalism" href="part0026_split_005.html#nationalism">nationalism</a>, a sense of identification with one’s people expressed through a common set of strongly held beliefs. Nationalism can be highly political, involving attempts to assert the power of a nation based on a shared ethnic or racial identity over people of a different ethnicity or race. The strife in the former Yugoslavia, and in parts of Africa and the former Soviet Union, bear tragic witness to the power of nationalism. The world of the twenty-first century may well witness responses to globalization that celebrate ethnocentric nationalist beliefs, promoting intolerance and hatred rather than acceptance of diversity.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">New nationalisms, cultural identities, and religious practices are constantly being forged throughout the world. When you socialize with students from the same cultural background or celebrate traditional holidays with friends and family, you are sustaining your culture. The very technology that helps foster globalization also supports local cultures: The Internet enables you to communicate with others who share your cultural identity, even when they are dispersed around the world. A casual search of the web reveals thousands of pages devoted to different cultures and subcultures.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although sociologists do not fully understand these processes, they often conclude that despite the powerful forces of globalization, local cultures remain strong. But it is too soon to tell whether and how globalization will result in the homogenization of the world’s cultures, the flourishing of many individual cultures, or both.</p>
