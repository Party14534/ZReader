<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Gendered Inequalities in the Workplace</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Gender plays a powerful role in shaping workplace experiences. Everything from the jobs we hold, to how much we earn, to even our treatment at the hands of coworkers, is powerfully shaped by gender. Although women have seen tremendous progress in both rates of labor force participation and entry to a wide variety of occupations over the past century, as we shall see, stark inequities persist.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Women currently account for roughly half (47 percent) of the total workforce. This proportion is a stark increase from 1950, when women represented just 30 percent of the paid workforce. Nearly 57 percent of women are now employed outside the home, up from just 34 percent of women in 1950 (BLS, 2017h; BLS, 2019e). Although women’s entry into the paid labor force is a fairly contemporary phenomenon, dating back only to the early 1970s, some women have always worked for pay. Poor, immigrant, and ethnic minority women have always had relatively high rates of employment. For example, in the United States in the early twentieth century, the female labor force consisted mainly of young, single women and children. More than a third of gainfully employed women were maids or house servants. When women or girls worked in factories or offices, employers often sent their wages to their parents. When young women married, they typically withdrew from the labor force.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Since then, women’s participation in the paid labor force has risen more or less continuously, especially since the 1950s (Figure 10.1). However, since peaking at 60 percent in 2009, women’s labor force participation has declined slightly. Men’s rates of labor force participation declined over this period, from 86 percent in 1950 to 80 percent in 1970 to roughly 69 percent in 2018. These patterns largely reflect the fact that more younger men are in college and more older men are exiting the labor force in their fifties and sixties, due either to the early onset of work-related disabilities, or the fact that Social Security benefits enable them to retire comfortably—a benefit that was not available in the 1950s and 1960s (BLS, 2017d; BLS, 2019e). A more telling number may be the proportion of men in their prime working years, ages 25 to 54, who are currently working. In 2000, fully 92 percent of men in that age group were working, although the figure had dipped slightly to 89 percent by 2018 (Fox, 2017; BLS, 2019e).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Macroeconomic conditions are an important influence on the gender composition of the paid labor force. For instance, during the Great Recession of the late 2000s and early 2010s, men’s employment rates dropped more steeply than women’s employment rates because the types of jobs men work in were affected more severely (Mulligan, 2010). Men are more likely than women to work in the industries of finance, insurance, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_350" title="350"></span>real estate, and construction, which were particularly hard hit during the recession. Some pundits went so far as to dub the economic downturn a “he-cession” or “man-cession” to reflect the fact that 80 percent of the jobs lost were jobs held by men. Some would argue further that women’s employment was essential for families’ financial well-being during this difficult economic period.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Perhaps an even greater change in labor force participation has occurred among married mothers of young children. In 1978, only 14 percent of married women with preschool-age children worked full time year-round, yet this figure had increased to 59.6 percent by 2018; three-quarters (76.4 percent) of women with children between the ages of 6 and 17 were in the labor force in 2015 (BLS, 2019g). One impetus behind women’s increased entry into the labor force was the increasing demand for clerical and service workers in the mid-twentieth century, as the U.S. economy expanded and changed (Oppenheimer, 1970). From 1940 until the late 1960s, labor force activity increased among women who were past their prime child-rearing years, such as “empty nest” women whose children had left the family home. During the 1970s and 1980s, as the marriage age rose, fertility declined, and women’s educational attainment increased, the growth in labor force participation spread to younger women. Many women now postpone marriage and child-rearing to complete their education and establish themselves in the labor force. Despite family obligations, today, a majority of women of all educational levels work outside the home during their child-rearing years (Padavic and Reskin, 2002). Unmarried mothers are even more likely than married <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_351" title="351"></span>mothers to work during their child-rearing years. In 2018, 76.7 percent of unmarried mothers with children under 18 years old were in the labor force, compared with 69 percent of married mothers (BLS, 2019g).</p>
<section id="occupational-segregation">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Occupational Segregation</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Until recently, women were overwhelmingly concentrated in routine, poorly paid occupations. The clerk (office worker) provides a good illustration. In 1850 in the United States, clerks held responsible positions requiring accountancy skills and carrying managerial responsibilities; fewer than 1 percent were women. The twentieth century saw a general mechanization of office work (starting with the introduction of the typewriter in the late nineteenth century), accompanied by a downgrading of the clerk’s status—in tandem with an analogous occupation, secretary—into a routine, low-paid occupation. Women filled these occupations as the pay and prestige of such jobs declined (Reskin and Roos, 1990). In 2016, 94 percent of all secretaries and administrative assistants in the United States were women (BLS, 2018a).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Studies of certain occupations reveal how <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-gender-typing" href="part0068_split_005.html#gender-typing">gender typing</a> occurs in the workplace. Expanding areas of lower-level work, such as secretarial or retail sales positions, attract a substantial proportion of women. These jobs are poorly paid and hold few career prospects. Men with good educational qualifications aspire to something higher, whereas others choose blue-collar work. Once an occupation has become gender typed, inertia sets in: Job hierarchies are built around the assumption that men will occupy superior positions, while a stream of women will flow through subordinate jobs. Employers are guided in future hiring decisions by gender labels. And the very conditions of most female jobs lead to adaptive responses on the part of women—low job commitment, few career ambitions, high turnover, the seeking of alternative rewards in social relations—which fortify the image of women as suitable for only lower-level jobs (Lowe, 1987). These social conditions reinforce outlooks produced by early gender socialization, as women may grow up believing that they should put their husbands’ careers before their own. (Men also are frequently brought up to believe the same thing.)</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Women have recently made inroads into occupations once defined as “men’s jobs.” By the 1990s, women constituted a majority of workers in previously male-dominated professions such as accounting, journalism, psychology, and public service. In fields such as law, medicine, and engineering, the proportion of women rose substantially between 1970 and 2019 (Figure 10.2). Women now account for more than one-third of all lawyers and physicians. Further, for the first time ever, in the 2008–2009 academic year, American women earned more doctoral degrees than men. In 2017, women earned 54 percent of all doctoral degrees. However, men continue to earn a majority of doctorates in traditionally male-dominated fields such as engineering (76 percent) and mathematics and statistics (71 percent) (National Center for Education Statistics, 2018f; Okahana and Zhou, 2018; Glazer, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Recent evidence also suggests that the influx of women into particular fields may wax and wane over time. For example, women made tremendous inroads in <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_352" title="352"></span>computer programming in the 1970s and 1980s. The proportion of young women majoring in computer science tripled from roughly 13 percent to 36 percent between 1970 and 1985, yet these numbers have inched downward steadily over the past three decades. Today, just slightly more than 15 percent of college women are majoring in computer science, a trend that experts attribute to a fascinating and counterintuitive phenomenon: the proliferation of home computers in the 1980s and forward (Hinn, 2014). As more and more homes would acquire PCs (and computer games), the perception spread that computer games and video games were “for boys.” A content analysis of video games would certainly reinforce that assumption, where male characters outnumber women characters by roughly six to one (Williams et al., 2009). Popular films in the 1980s like <i class="italic">War Games</i> and <i class="italic">Weird Science</i> underscored the notion that boys, but not girls, could use computers for fun, adventure, and both professional and social advancement. As a result, parents, peers, and school teachers may have subtly conveyed the messages to young women that computer science wasn’t for them, thus contributing to the plummeting numbers of female computer science majors in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries (Hinn, 2014). However, national educational initiatives like Girls Who Code, events like Girls in Tech Hackathons, and even the recent popularity of the film <i class="italic">Hidden Figures</i> may be instrumental in encouraging girls, and especially African American girls, to consider pursuing computer programming or other high-tech professions (Hatch, 2017; Leckart, 2015).</p>

<section id="the-glass-ceiling">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">The “Glass Ceiling”</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although women are increasingly entering traditionally male jobs, they may not be seeing increases in pay—or increases in occupational mobility—because of the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-glass-ceiling" href="part0068_split_005.html#glass-ceiling">glass ceiling</a>, a promotion barrier that prevents women’s upward mobility. The glass ceiling is particularly problematic in male-dominated occupations and professions, such as investment banking, as we learned <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_353" title="353"></span>earlier in this chapter. Women’s progress is blocked not by virtue of innate inability or lack of basic qualifications but by lack of the sponsorship of powerful senior colleagues to articulate the women’s value to the organization or profession (Alvarez et al., 1996). As a result, women progress into middle-management positions but do not, in proportionate numbers, move beyond them. The example of Kelley Voelker shows that, even today, women are subtly blocked access to high-level positions such as managing director (Lattman, 2010). One explanation for women’s blocked mobility is that dated gender stereotypes persist. Research shows that college-educated White males in professional jobs identify potential leaders as people who are like them. Women are thus assessed negatively because they deviate from this norm (Cleveland, 1996).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Ironically, men who work in female-dominated professions do not face similar obstacles to promotion. To the contrary, they enjoy a boost up the corporate ladder. In 1992, sociologist Christine Williams coined the term “glass escalator” (1992) to reflect men’s rapid ascent up the hierarchy when they work in female-dominated professions. She found that employers singled out male workers in traditionally female jobs—such as nurse, librarian, elementary school teacher, and social worker—and promoted them to top administrative jobs in disproportionately high numbers. These men often “face invisible pressures to move up in their professions. Like being on a moving escalator, they have to work to stay in place,” writes Williams (1992). These pressures may take positive forms, such as close mentoring and encouragement from supervisors, or they may be the result of prejudicial attitudes of those outside the profession, such as clients who prefer to work with male rather than female executives.</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/></div>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 2013, however, Williams updated her theory to more fully reflect the concept of intersectionality. She now argues that the glass escalator is most beneficial and relevant <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_354" title="354"></span>to White men who hold stable middle-class jobs, noting that “gay men and racial/ethnic minority men, in particular, seemed to be excluded from the benefits of the glass escalator” (Williams, 2013). She further notes that not all workplaces have a glass escalator; rather, the escalator operates only in organizations with stable employment, clear-cut job hierarchies, and career ladders—all aspects of the workplace that have changed dramatically over the past two decades.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The glass ceiling is one of several reasons women continue to earn less than men, although the gender pay gap has narrowed considerably in recent years (Figure 10.3). Between 1960 and 2018, the ratio of women’s to men’s earnings among full-time, year-round workers increased from 61 to 81 percent. Moreover, this ratio increased among all races and ethnic groups, yet gaps remain. For example, in 2018, White women earned 82 percent as much as their male counterparts, compared with 89 percent for Black women, 86 percent for Hispanic women, and 76 percent for Asian women (BLS, 2019r). Scholars disagree about why the gender gap persists; we will delve more deeply into these competing perspectives later in the chapter.</p>

<section id="gender-inequities-in-entrepreneurship">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Gender Inequities in Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Entrepreneurship, or starting one’s own business, has long been considered a pathway through which disadvantaged groups, typically immigrants, could circumvent workplace barriers and succeed on their own. But what about women? Can they break through the glass ceiling by breaking out on their own? The answer is mixed. The number of women with their own business has increased steadily over the past several decades. Women-owned firms now account for 38 percent of all enterprises and are growing faster in number than most other types of businesses. Yet women’s businesses tend to be much smaller than men’s. As a result, women-owned firms employ only 8 percent of the U.S. workforce and contribute 4 percent of business revenues (American Express OPEN, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Recent evidence suggests that women trying to start their own businesses face greater obstacles than men when trying to secure funding. Research by sociologist Sarah Thébaud sheds light on why women-owned businesses may be under-resourced: unfounded negative perceptions of women business owners by potential funders. In three experiments, Thébaud (2015) tested what a group of 178 college students thought about a series of business plans, and indirectly, the gender of the business owners behind them. In general, she found that the students rated women as less competent than men, even when the business plan was exactly the same. These studies show that the persistence of notions about gender difference perpetuates men’s advantages.</p>

<section id="sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_4">Sexual Harassment in the Workplace</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although most sociological research on gendered inequalities in the workplace focuses on occupational status and earnings, in recent years, scholars have identified sexual harassment as another important source of inequitable treatment. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-sexual-harassment" href="part0068_split_005.html#sexual-harassment">Sexual harassment</a> is unwanted or repeated sexual advances, remarks, and behavior that are offensive to the recipient and cause discomfort or interfere with job performance. Power imbalances facilitate harassment; even though <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_355" title="355"></span>women can and do sexually harass subordinates, it is more common for men to harass women because men usually hold positions of authority (Uggen and Blackstone, 2004).</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/></div>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the most high-visibility cases of sexual harassment in recent years is the 2017 debacle at Fox News. In a single year, Fox News chairman Roger Ailes and talk show host Bill O’Reilly were ousted following multiple charges of harassing women reporters and producers for more than a decade; the company’s copresident, Bill Shine, also resigned amid the turmoil. The Fox case garnered international attention because of the high profiles of the men involved, yet similar conditions happen at small firms every day. The U.S. courts have identified two types of sexual harassment. One is the quid pro quo, in which a supervisor demands sexual acts from a worker as a job condition or promises work-related benefits in exchange for sexual acts. The other is the “hostile work environment,” in which a pattern of sexual language, sexual advances, or even sexually explicit or demeaning posters makes a worker so uncomfortable that it is difficult for the worker to do their job (Padavic and Reskin, 2002).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In recent years, an increasing number of women working in the male-dominated high-tech industries of Silicon Valley have spoken up about the hostile work climates they have faced. For example, Whitney Wolfe, whom we met earlier in this chapter, filed a sexual harassment suit against Tinder. In the suit, Wolfe alleged that company cofounder Justin Mateen had stripped her of a cofounder title because she was a young “girl” who “makes the company look like a joke”—and that he called her a “whore,” “gold-digger,” and a “disease” (Valenti, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Recognition of sexual harassment and women’s willingness to report it have increased substantially since the testimony of Anita Hill to the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas’s 1991 nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. Hill’s recounting of Thomas’s harassment raised public awareness of the problem and encouraged more women to report incidents (Figure 10.4). <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_356" title="356"></span>In the first six months of 1992 alone, the number of workplace harassment complaints increased by more than 50 percent (Gross, 1992). An average of 12,000 sexual harassment complaints are filed each year (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC], 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Despite increased awareness, sociologists have observed that “the great majority of women who are abused by behavior that fits legal definitions of sexual harassment—and who are traumatized by the experience—do not label what has happened to them as sexual harassment” (Paludi and Barickman, 1991). Women’s reluctance to report may be due to the following factors: (1) many still do not recognize that sexual harassment is an actionable offense; (2) victims may be reluctant to make complaints, fearing that they will not be believed, that their charges will not be taken seriously, or that they will be subject to reprisals; and (3) it may be difficult to differentiate between harassment and joking on the job (Giuffre and Williams, 1994).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act outlaws harassment between members of the same sex. The case involved a man who had to quit his job on an offshore oil rig because he had been repeatedly grabbed, ridiculed, and threatened by two male supervisors. The Court ruled that neither “roughhousing” among men, nor “flirtations” between men and women, nor even some types of “verbal or physical harassment” are illegal, but that when sexual harassment is so “severely hostile or abusive” that it prevents workers from doing their jobs, it violates the Civil Rights Act—regardless of whether the offender and the harassed person are of the same or the opposite sex (Savage, 1998).</p>

<section id="global-gendered-inequalities-in-economic-well-being">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_5">Global Gendered Inequalities in Economic Well-Being</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The United States is not alone in having a history of gender inequality in the workplace. Across the globe, men outpace women in most workplace and economic indicators. Women around the world work in the lowest-wage jobs and are likely to make less than men doing similar work—although there is some evidence that the wage gap is slowly decreasing, at least in industrialized countries (OECD, 2012). As in the United States, most nations have witnessed tremendous strides in women’s economic progress in recent decades.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Globally, 50 percent of women participate in the labor force, compared to 76 percent of men. The International Labour Organization (2016) found that the gap between the labor force participation rates of men and women decreased only slightly between 1995 and 2015, mainly because both women’s and men’s participation rates have fallen. Women have high labor force participation rates in high-income countries, such as most European nations, where over two-thirds of the female adult population participate in the labor market and the male-female gap in labor force participation rates is less than 15 percent on average. This is especially true in nations with extensive social benefits (such as paid maternity leave) and where part-time work is possible. In North Africa and South Asia, by contrast, the gender gap in labor force participation is nearly 50 percent. Gender gaps are due largely to variations in women’s labor force participation rates, from a high of 86 percent of women in Rwanda to 16 percent in Jordan. In contrast, men’s participation rates are relatively stable across countries in different income strata.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because women throughout the world also perform a greater share of housework and child care at the end of the paid workday than men, often dubbed the “second <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_357" title="357"></span>shift,” women work longer hours than men in most developed countries, including the United States. On average, working women in developed nations work 32 minutes more per day than working men (8 hours and 9 minutes, compared to 7 hours and 36 minutes). This gap is even worse in developing nations: 9 hours and 20 minutes for women versus 8 hours and 7 minutes for men (ILO, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Women remain in the poorest-paying industrial and service-sector jobs in all countries, and in the less industrialized nations, they are concentrated in the declining agricultural sector. The feminization of the global workforce has brought with it the increased exploitation of young, uneducated, largely rural women around the world. These women labor under conditions that are often unsafe and unhealthy, at low pay and with nonexistent job security. As noted in <a href="part0059_split_000.html#1O8H60-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 9</a>, one of the most tragic examples of unsafe work environments was the April 2013 collapse of the eight-story Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh’s capital city of Dhaka. More than 1,100 people working in garment and apparel factories housed in the building—most of whom were women—died in the collapse, and another 2,500 injured workers were pulled from the wreckage (Fitch, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Despite such tragedies and often unsafe conditions, even poor-paying factory jobs may enable some women to achieve a measure of economic independence and power. Some scholars and activists argue further that women’s economic empowerment has contributed in large part to China’s meteoric rise as an economic power. An estimated 80 percent of the factory workers in China’s Guangdong province are female, and 6 of the 10 richest self-made women in the world are Chinese (Sorvino, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">At the other end of the occupational spectrum, a recent study by the ILO concluded that women throughout the world still encounter a “glass ceiling” that restricts their movement into the top positions. Even though women have made progress in moving into managerial and professional positions, globally, 6 percent or less of the CEOs of the largest corporations are women, and those who do make it to the top typically earn less than their male counterparts (ILO, 2015; Catalyst, 2020a).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Recognition of these inequities is sparking state-level policies and initiatives to promote greater gender equity. In Japan, for example, women have been particularly likely to face barriers to career advancement, especially in professional and managerial positions. Only 13 percent of such positions are now held by women, due both to discriminatory hiring practices and the fact that fully 70 percent of Japanese women exit the workforce when they have their first child (Cunningham, 2013; Simms, 2013; Smith, 2019). However, policy makers in Japan recognize that this is a tremendous loss of worker potential, especially when low birthrates mean that the nation may soon face a dearth of young workers. In 2013, the government issued a mandate that by 2020, women should hold 30 percent of all upper-management positions in major corporations (Cunningham, 2013). Similar quota-based policies have already been passed in France, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Spain (ILO, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Female participation in senior management is rising, with women filling 18 percent of senior leadership roles in 2019. Women make up 27 percent of board members of major companies in the European Union (Eurostat, 2018). In many developing countries, greater progress has been made than in developed ones: In the Philippines and Indonesia, for example, more than 40 percent of senior managers are women. Regionally, women’s share of senior management jobs is highest in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where 38 percent of senior roles are held by women, including <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_358" title="358"></span>47 percent in Russia and 40 percent in Poland. The reason for these countries’ high proportion of women in professional jobs is their long-standing policies supporting working mothers (Grant Thornton, 2017).</p>
