<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Social Mobility: Moving Up and Down the Ladder</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The United States has long been hailed as the land of opportunity. “Rags-to-riches” stories abound, offering inspiring accounts of people such as Liz Murray, the homeless daughter of drug-addicted parents who ultimately graduated from Harvard University <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_261" title="261"></span>(Murray, 2010). Movies and novels recount the triumphs of the secretary or mailroom worker who became a corporate vice president. Is it possible for a young person from a poor or working-class background to transcend class roots and become an upper-class professional? If yes, what factors contribute to their ascent up the social ladder?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Answers to these questions can be found in the study of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-mobility" href="part0056_split_004.html#social-mobility">social mobility</a>, which refers to the upward or downward movement of individuals and groups among different class positions through changes in occupation, wealth, or income. Mobility can occur in one of two forms. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-intergenerational-mobility" href="part0056_split_004.html#intergenerational-mobility">Intergenerational mobility</a> refers to social movement across generations; we can analyze where children are on the scale compared with their parents or grandparents. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-intragenerational-mobility" href="part0056_split_004.html#intragenerational-mobility">Intragenerational mobility</a>, by contrast, refers to how far an individual moves up or down the socioeconomic scale during their working life. Another important distinction is between structural mobility and exchange mobility. Most mobility, whether intragenerational or intergenerational, is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-structural-mobility" href="part0056_split_004.html#structural-mobility">structural mobility</a>—upward mobility made possible by an expansion of better-paid occupations at the expense of poorly paid ones. Most mobility in the United States since World War II has depended on continually increasing prosperity. In a hypothetical society with complete equality of opportunity—in which each person has the same chance of success as everyone else—there would be a great deal of downward as well as upward mobility. This is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-exchange-mobility" href="part0056_split_004.html#exchange-mobility">exchange mobility</a>—an exchange of positions such that more talented people in each generation move up the economic hierarchy, while the less talented move down. In practice, however, no society approaches full equality of opportunity.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In a classic study of intergenerational mobility in the United States, sociologists Peter Blau and Otis Dudley Duncan (1967) found that long-range intergenerational mobility—that is, from working class to upper middle class—was rare. Why? Blau and Duncan concluded that the key factor behind occupational status was educational attainment. A child’s education, however, is influenced by family social status; this, in turn, affects the child’s social position later in life. Sociologists William Sewell and Robert Hauser (1980) later confirmed Blau and Duncan’s conclusions. They added to the argument by claiming that the connection between family background and educational attainment occurs because parents, teachers, and friends influence the child’s educational and career aspirations, and that these aspirations then become an important influence on the schooling and careers obtained throughout the child’s life.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we learned earlier in this chapter, French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1984, 1988) also examined the importance of family background to social status, but his emphasis was on the cultural advantages that parents can provide to their children. Bourdieu argued that among the factors responsible for social status, the most <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_262" title="262"></span>important is the transmission of “<a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-cultural-capital" href="part0056_split_004.html#cultural-capital">cultural capital</a>,” or the cultural advantages that being from a “good home” confers. Wealthier families are able to afford to send their children to better schools, an economic advantage that benefits the children’s social status as adults. Parents from the upper and middle classes are mostly highly educated themselves and tend to be more involved in their children’s education—reading to them, helping with homework, purchasing books and learning materials, and encouraging their progress. Bourdieu noted that working-class parents are concerned about their children’s education, but they lack the economic or cultural capital to make a difference.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although Bourdieu focused on social status in France, the socioeconomic order in the United States is similar. Those who already hold positions of wealth and power can ensure that their children have the best available education, and this education will often lead them into the best jobs. Studies consistently show that a large majority of people who have “made money” did so by inheriting it or being given at least a modest amount initially—which they then used to make more. In U.S. society, it’s better to start at the top than at the bottom.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One recent study of more than 40 million children and their parents found that social mobility in the United States has not changed much over the past 50 years. In fact, contrary to popular myth, social mobility has long been low, not high (Chetty et al., 2014). Among children born into the bottom fifth of the U.S. income distribution, only 7.5 percent wound up in the top fifth; two out of five remain poor as adults. By way of comparison, fully one-third of those born into the top fifth remained in the top <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_263" title="263"></span>fifth. While being born at the top is no guarantee one will remain there, the odds are far greater than for someone born at the bottom.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">Higher education provides a path to upward mobility in the United States, but getting into college is often contingent upon one’s social background.</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The study also found that there are significant differences in upward mobility by geographic area. For example, children from the bottom fifth of families who grow up in the Silicon Valley area near San Jose, California—the home of Stanford University, Apple, Google, Facebook, and countless other high-tech firms—have a 13 percent chance of reaching the top fifth; the odds of this happening for a child who grows up in Charlotte, North Carolina, is just 4 percent. Mobility is higher in areas that have less residential segregation and income inequality, better primary schools, higher family stability, and, importantly, greater “social capital” in the form of community involvement and personal networks (Chetty et al., 2014; Surowiecki, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Race and education play a major part in determining upward mobility. Sixty-three percent of Black children born into the bottom fourth of the U.S. income distribution remained in the bottom fourth, while only 4 percent made it into the top fourth. Among White children, 32 percent of those born into the bottom fourth remained there, while 14 percent made it into the top fourth. In other words, while upward mobility is not high for anyone, it is far lower for Blacks than it is for Whites. Differences in education account for at least part of the racial differences. Because schools remain highly segregated by race in many parts of the country, poor Black children often do not have the same educational opportunities as Whites do (Hertz, 2006).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One’s parents’ income has a strong effect on whether one goes to college. In 2016, 78 percent of young adults from the top 20 percent of American households were enrolled in postsecondary education, compared to just 28 percent of those in the bottom 20 percent (NCES, 2019b). One key reason is that children born into lower-income families are more likely to drop out of high school or, if they complete high school, do so without the preparation and grades that would qualify them for college (NCES, 2016b; Cameron and Heckman, 2001).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the most important avenues to upward intergenerational mobility is therefore higher education. One study found that at all income levels, a college education paid off. Children who earned a college degree were significantly more likely to earn more than their parents than were children who did not graduate from college. Moreover, the differences were largest for middle-class children, suggesting that the returns on education were greater for this group than for the very poor or the very wealthy (Haskins, 2009). Fully 60 percent of children from families in the top fifth of income earners graduated from college, whereas in the bottom fifth of earners, just 15 percent attained college degrees (Cahalan et al., 2016). Although a college degree may open the door to well-paying managerial and professional occupations, the returns on education, such as the economic payoff received in the workplace for each additional year of schooling or academic degree, is not equal for all Americans. As we will learn in subsequent chapters, each additional academic degree brings much richer financial and occupational rewards for men versus women and Whites versus Blacks and Latinos.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Further, the very process of applying to, being accepted to, and graduating from college, especially prestigious colleges, is shaped by one’s social background. To obtain a “behind-the-scenes” look at who is accepted to prestigious colleges, sociologist Mitchell Stevens (2009) conducted an ethnographic study in which he spent a year and a half working in the admissions office of an elite New England college. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_264" title="264"></span>college was proud of its high academic standards, social conscience, and commitment to diversity. In practice, however, the admissions process often reproduced preexisting inequalities, Stevens found. Although admissions officers did strive for diversity in each entering class, they typically targeted Black and Latino students from economically advantaged backgrounds, rather than those from disadvantaged communities in the inner city or rural areas. Working-class Whites and ethnic minorities, even those with quite stellar records, often were left out in the cold. An NCES (2019b) study found that 37 percent of higher income students (top 20 percent) are enrolled at highly selective universities as compared to the 7 percent enrollment of students from the lowest 20 percent income.</p>
<section id="downward-mobility">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Downward Mobility</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Downward mobility is less common than upward mobility, yet the 2008 recession resulted in an uptick in the percentage of Americans who moved down the social ladder—either down from their parents’ status (intergenerational mobility) or down from their own earlier economic status (intragenerational mobility). For example, one study found that a middle-class upbringing does not guarantee the same status over the course of a lifetime (Acs, 2011). One-third of Americans raised in the middle class—defined as those who grew up in households between the thirtieth and seventieth percentiles of the income distribution—fall out of the middle class as adults.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">Men line up for a New York job fair. The 2008 recession was termed a “mancession” because the economic downturn impacted predominantly male professions like construction and manufacturing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Downward intergenerational mobility also has increased in recent years. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, corporate America was flooded with instances in which <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_265" title="265"></span>middle-aged men lost their jobs because of company mergers, takeovers, or bankruptcies. These executives either had difficulty finding new jobs or could only find jobs that paid less than their previous ones (Newman, 1999). Among the industries most strongly affected by the recent economic downturn were finance, construction, and real estate, which primarily employ men.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The most common type of downward intergenerational mobility is short-range downward mobility. Here, a worker moves from one job to another that is similar in pay and prestige (for example, from a routine office job to semiskilled blue-collar work). Although such moves may seem fairly minor, they are often accompanied by quite serious psychological costs and may create family strains. Men and women who stake their identity on having a well-paying and rewarding job may find themselves despondent working in a job that provides neither rich earnings nor the prestige and satisfaction that accompanied their prior job (Warner, 2010).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For women, both inter- and intragenerational downward mobility may have an additional source: divorce. One study found that women who divorced were between 31 and 36 percentage points more likely than their married counterparts to fall down the economic ladder (Acs, 2011). Studies also show that the fortunes of adult women change dramatically upon divorce. Newman (1999) tracked the experiences of upper-middle-class suburban mothers who found themselves struggling to maintain their former lifestyles after divorce. As we will learn more about in <a href="part0096_split_000.html#2RHM00-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 15</a>, women’s standard of living drops by as much as 33 percent after divorce.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Ironically, the recent recession may have actually contributed to higher rates of female labor force participation. As in the Great Depression, so today women are generally paid less and maintain jobs that do not feel the effects of the economic downturn in the same way that predominantly “male” professions (e.g., construction or manufacturing) do. As a result, some scholars referred to the economic downturn as a “mancession,” in which men suffered greater job losses than women did (Newman and Pedulla, 2010).</p>
