<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">The Gender Pay Gap: Why Do Women Earn Less Than Men?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The gender gap in pay is widely recognized. As we learned earlier in this chapter, women currently earn around 81 cents for every dollar earned by a man (BLS, 2019r). While the gender gap is now at its narrowest in history, experts believe that much of the recent convergence reflects the fact that men’s wages took a hard hit during the 2008 recession. In other words, men are losing ground relative to women, and women are not necessarily seeing an objective improvement in their economic standing. What factors account for women’s persistent disadvantage?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many sociologists view <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-sex-segregation" href="part0069_split_004.html#sex-segregation">sex segregation</a>—the concentration of men and women in different occupations—as a cause of the gender gap in earnings. For instance, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_363" title="363"></span>according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, occupations with the highest proportion of women include secretary, child-care worker, hairdresser, payroll clerk, receptionist, dental hygienist, speech-language pathologist, elementary and middle school teacher, maids and household cleaners, and nurse. Occupations with the highest proportion of male workers include construction worker, truck driver, pilot, plumber, electrician, carpenter, firefighter, auto mechanic, and machinist (BLS, 2019k; IWPR, 2019).</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">Sociologists point to sex segregation as a key component of the gender pay gap. Women are disproportionately represented in positions that put them in a subordinate position, such as dental hygienist.</figcaption>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sex segregation is problematic because the gender composition of a job is associated with the pay received for that job. This finding has emerged in numerous studies. An analysis of 1980 Census data (England, 1992) showed that both women and men are disadvantaged by employment in an occupation that is predominantly female. Even “after adjusting for cognitive, social, and physical skill demands, amenities, disamenities, demands for effort, and industrial and organization characteristics, jobs pay less if they contain a higher proportion of females” (England, 1992). More recent analyses show that these patterns have not changed over time, and jobs predominantly held by women have considerably lower wages than jobs largely held by men (Hegewisch and Hartmann, 2014). Ironically, though, as noted in our earlier discussion of the glass escalator, the gender gap persists even among female-dominated occupations. For example, even though women accounted for the vast majority of social workers and elementary/secondary school teachers, women in these jobs earned just 94 percent and 86 percent, respectively, of what their male colleagues earned (IWPR, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Economists and sociologists differ in explaining how occupational segregation leads to a gender gap in pay. Economists focus on women’s occupational choices, while sociologists focus on the constraints women face. Many economists—as well as employers and public policy makers—endorse a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-human-capital-theory" href="part0069_split_004.html#human-capital-theory">human capital theory</a> explanation. Developed by Gary Becker (1964), the theory argues that individuals make investments in their own “human capital” (such as formal schooling, on-the-job training, and work experience) to increase their productivity and earnings. Those who invest more in their own skills and knowledge are considered more productive and consequently are paid higher wages.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Human capital theorists reason that women select occupations that are easy to move in and out of and that offer flexible or part-time hours while still providing moderately good incomes. Central to this <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_364" title="364"></span>argument is the assumption that women’s primary allegiance is to home and family; they seek undemanding or flexible jobs that require little personal investment in training or skills acquisition so that they can better tend to household responsibilities. When women leave the labor force to rear children, their job skills deteriorate, and they suffer a wage penalty when they reenter. Moreover, employers may “invest” less in women workers because they believe women will work less continuously than men.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Feminist sociologists criticize human capital theory on several grounds. For example, they dispute the claim that women “choose” certain occupations. In fact, the forces blocking women from freely choosing a career may be indirect or direct. Childhood socialization promoting traditional gender roles may lead young women to choose occupations that are viewed as compatible with feminine traits such as warmth and nurturance—for example, teaching or nursing. More direct obstacles include discouragement from guidance counselors and college advisers, and discrimination on the part of bosses, coworkers, and customers. Also, workplace “gatekeepers” prohibit women from entering certain occupations.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For example, a class-action case was brought against Costco by more than 700 women workers on the grounds that store management practices prevented women from securing jobs as assistant managers or general managers (Greenhouse and Barbaro, 2007). In January 2014, as part of their settlement, Costco agreed to distribute $8 million in compensation to current and former employees who were incorrectly denied promotions. The company also agreed to evaluate its procedures for promoting assistant general managers and general managers to ensure fairer and less gender-biased practices.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists further argue that human capital theory neglects power differentials between men and women in the workplace and society. Numerous studies reveal that even when men and women are in the same job, men are paid more (Institute for Women’s Policy Research, 2019). Because women’s work is devalued by society and by employers, women are rewarded less for their work. Moreover, women’s relative powerlessness prevents them from redefining the work they do as “skilled.” As long as jobs predominantly filled by women, such as caring for children and the elderly, are viewed as “unskilled” or even “intuitive,” and thus requiring little training, wages in women’s jobs will remain low.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These competing explanations have very different implications for the future. According to human capital theory, the gender gap in pay could disappear if women and men received equal amounts of education and workplace training and if they took equal responsibility for family commitments such as child care. If feminist sociologists are correct in arguing that women’s work is devalued, a drastic change in gender ideology must occur if men and women are to become equally rewarded for their participation in the workplace.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Increasing Gender Pay Equity: Lessons from Sweden</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Gender and family scholars believe that the United States could follow the lead of other nations that have established effective policies to help achieve greater gender equity in the home and the labor force (Blau and Kahn, 2013). Swedish parents receive 480 days of paid parental leave, which they can take at any time until their child turns eight. And, recognizing that some parents do not want to return to full-time work after their 480 days have run out, the Swedish government gives workers the legal right to hold onto their jobs and cut back their hours by 25 percent until their child turns <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_365" title="365"></span>eight, although their pay reflects only those hours they work. Parents have state-supported flexibility even after they go back to work; if they need to pick up their child from school or take a few days off to care for a sick child, workers still receive 80 percent of their pay.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Similar policies are available in most other European nations and Australia. Current policies in the United States are far less generous, and they are available only to a small fraction of workers. The Family &amp; Medical Leave Act (FMLA), passed during the Clinton administration, allows eligible employees to take up to 12 weeks of <i class="italic">unpaid</i> leave during any one-year period to care for a new infant or unhealthy family member. However, the benefit extends only to those who have worked for their present company for at least 12 months and worked at least 1,250 hours during that period. Moreover, the FMLA applies only to companies that employ 50 or more workers. Given these rigid restrictions, a study by the Center for American Progress found that only 12 percent of all American employees work for companies that are eligible for FMLA (Glynn, 2015).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The payoff of more generous policies, like those in Sweden, is well documented. Family-friendly policies help boost parents’ (and especially mothers’) rates of employment and their lifetime earnings. Workers who are offered paid parental leave are more likely to return to the same firm, which in turn increases the firm’s profitability by improving productivity and reducing turnover and absenteeism (Livingston, 2016).</p>
