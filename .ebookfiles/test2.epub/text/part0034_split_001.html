<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Does the use of an iPod affect public social conduct? This is the question asked by Christine Miranda, a junior at Princeton University who wanted to know how receptive iPod users were to strangers. Comparing the behavior of individuals using iPods with those not using them, she embarked on a study in New York’s subway system and began to document interactions between iPod users and nonusers on the 6 train on the east side of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">You might expect that iPod users on the subway would be unwilling or unhappy to speak with you (answers <i class="italic">b</i>, <i class="italic">c</i>, or <i class="italic">d</i>). Given that someone listening to music via headphones is preoccupied with another task, you would probably be wary about approaching them. People not wearing the trademark white earbuds likely appear more open to conversation, (literally) more able to hear what you have to say.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Miranda’s study put this commonsense hypothesis to the test. Boarding a subway car, she noted whether people possessed iPods; their positioning in relation to her; and their race, sex, and approximate age. In addition to observing users’ and nonusers’ responses to interactions, she noted cues such as body language and facial gestures, and recorded exchanges between users and nonusers, as well as interactions involving auditory interruptions, invasions of physical space, and sexual offenses.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sometimes Miranda simply observed naturally occurring interactions; for example, she observed the responses of users and nonusers to a panhandler petitioning for donations. At other times, she acted as the “confederate,” or intruder, interrupting an iPod user to ask about the train’s last stop. She asked similar questions of nonusers as well, seeking to determine whether iPod users were less eager or less willing to respond.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Miranda found that iPod users seemed just as open to providing useful information as nonusers. Thus, answer <i class="italic">a</i> is actually correct. Among the iPod users, no one she asked seemed to mind removing their headphones long enough to provide an answer; indeed, the users she asked seemed more courteous than the nonusers. Having offered the information requested, however, iPod users promptly went back to listening to their music. (Similarly, nonusers who were reading when she asked <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_135" title="135"></span>them went back to their newspapers or books, and those engaged in conversation went back to talking.)</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Corroborating the popular hypothesis just detailed, most subway riders, Miranda discovered, perceived iPod users as less approachable. So, while most users seemed happy to offer information that was requested of them, they were less likely than nonusers to be asked in the first place. Indeed, Miranda noted: “The personal stereo presents an opportunity to block off the outside environment and to reduce the likelihood of being approached, but when social conduct does occur, the user’s behavior is not much different from the nonuser’s.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">She concluded that while the personal stereo presents the illusion of separation, making a user appear less approachable, this “wall can be easily broken when we simply disrupt a person’s personal space with words or actions.” It may initially take a bit more effort to get the attention of an iPod user, whose senses may be somewhat dulled compared with those of a more alert nonuser. However, when a true attempt is made to get an iPod user to interact (for example, by asking a pointed question), the iPod user seems as open to interruption as the nonuser. After the interaction, however, it is generally understood that iPod users will go about their own business without acknowledging those around them.</p>
