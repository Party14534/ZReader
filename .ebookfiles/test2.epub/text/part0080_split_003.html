<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Social Isolation</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Old age historically has been considered a time of social isolation. Disengagement theory proposed that it was beneficial for both the older adult and society if the older person gradually withdrew from their social roles and relationships (Cumming and Henry, 1961). Similarly, classic role theories held that the loss of the work role for men (via retirement) and loss of the wife role for women (via widowhood) would leave older adults socially isolated and despondent (Biddle, 1986). More recent research counters, however, that while loneliness and social isolation are problematic, they are neither inevitable nor universal features of aging.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most older adults have family members and friends they can turn to. Four out of five older people have living children, and the vast majority of them can rely on their children for support if necessary. More than 9 out of 10 adult children say that maintaining parental contact is important to them, including the provision of financial support if it is needed (Suitor et al., 2011). The reverse is also true: Many studies have found that aged parents continue to provide support for their adult children, particularly during times of difficulty, such as divorce. Most older parents and adult children report feeling that the amount of support they receive from the other is fair, and that their relationship is close and loving (Birditt, Jackey, and Antonucci, 2009). Most older adults have regular contact with their children and live near them; about 85 percent of older persons live within an hour of one of their children. However, relatively few live with their children. This arrangement is exactly what they want; studies repeatedly show that older adults—even those with serious physical health limitations—prefer to remain independent and reside in their own homes. They want “intimacy at a distance” (Gans and Silverstein, 2006).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">However, in spring 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic raged, most older adults were advised to quarantine in their homes, to minimize their risk of contracting the virus through social contact. This isolation was mandated for residents of long-term care facilities like nursing homes and hospitalized persons, who were prohibited from having visitors. Although educated older adults who were computer-savvy could remain engaged with their friends and family through videoconferencing platforms, the well-documented “digital divide” meant that those who lacked computers and smartphones were the most isolated (Morrow-Howell et al., 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As tragic as this isolation was, isolation and loneliness are not necessarily synonymous. Over the past three decades, researchers have discovered that loneliness is not triggered by a quantitative lack of relationships, but rather by a lack of satisfaction with the number or quality of one’s relationships. Contemporary researchers have identified distinct types of loneliness: <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-emotional-loneliness" href="part0080_split_008.html#emotional-loneliness">Emotional loneliness</a> refers to the absence of an intimate confidant, while <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-loneliness" href="part0080_split_008.html#social-loneliness">social loneliness</a> refers to the absence of a broader social network. The two types often overlap; widowed persons, those living alone, or those living far away from their friends and families consistently report higher levels of both types of loneliness than persons who are more socially integrated, such as married persons or those who live with their adult children (de Jong Gierveld and Havens, 2004).</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_436" title="436"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The mere presence of personal relationships does not ward off loneliness, however. An estimated 25 percent of older married persons report emotional and social loneliness; this pattern is particularly common among persons whose spouses are ill, who have a dissatisfying (or nonexistent) sexual relationship, and who have infrequent or conflicted conversations (de Jong Gierveld et al., 2009). As de Jong Gierveld and Havens (2004) noted, loneliness depends on one’s “standards as to what constitutes an optimal network of relationships.” That is, it’s getting less support than we want rather than the objective number of social ties that matters when it comes to loneliness.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Despite its subjective nature, loneliness is a serious problem for many older adults; it is linked to sleep problems, poor cardiovascular health, and elevated blood pressure, each of which carries long-term consequences for mortality risk (Cacioppo et al., 2002). Loneliness also may be a particularly serious social problem for older adults in future generations. Smaller families and increased rates of divorce and childlessness among future cohorts of older adults may create a context where older persons maintain objectively fewer relationships, thus triggering social loneliness (Manning and Brown, 2011). More important, however, some have argued that current cohorts of midlife adults have unrealistically high expectations for what their social relationships should provide (e.g., one’s partner should be their “soul mate”); if these lofty expectations go unfulfilled, then older adults may report higher levels of emotional loneliness as well (Carr and Moorman, 2011).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Who Suffers More: Women or Men?</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Researchers continue to debate whether men or women are more socially isolated in later life. Women are less likely than men to be married, yet they tend to have richer social and emotional ties to children and friends. These ties reflect patterns of lifelong <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_437" title="437"></span>gender socialization, where women are raised to emphasize social relationships and men are raised to be independent and autonomous (Carr and Moorman, 2011).</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Statistics confirm that older women are far less likely than men to be married. Because men die younger than women, women are more likely than men to become widowed. Women also are more likely than men to remain widowed; a dearth of eligible male partners prevents most older women from remarrying. Among people 65 and older in the United States, there are about 1.25 women per man (125 women for every 100 men), and this gap increases to nearly 2.0 women for every man by age 85 (189 women for every 100 men). As a result, only 11 percent of men ages 65 and older were widowers in 2018; by contrast, 32 percent of older women were widowed. Given the stark gender gap in widowhood, women are much more likely than men to live alone (34 percent versus 21 percent). By age 75, nearly half of women (44 percent) live alone (Administration for Community Living, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">However, as we have just learned, being single and living alone does not necessarily mean loneliness. Many older women report that they have little interest in dating and remarrying. Carr (2004) estimated that 18 months after becoming widowed, only 10 percent of older women (yet 20 percent of men) were dating, and just 15 percent of women (yet nearly 40 percent of men) said that they would like to date. Some older women report that they do not want to remarry because they do not want to take on the homemaking and caregiving responsibilities that often accompany marriage to an older man (van den Hoonard, 2002).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Women’s more emotionally intimate social relations over the life course are an important resource as they adjust to spousal loss and social isolation. Older widows receive more practical and emotional support from their children than do widowers, given mothers’ closer relationships with their children throughout the life course. Women also are more likely to have larger and more varied friendship networks than men, and these friendships provide an important source of support to women as they cope with the strains of late life (Ha, 2008).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Men, by contrast, are more likely than women to experience physical health declines, increased disability, and heightened risk of mortality after their spouses die. While popular lore claims that widowers may “die of a broken heart,” research shows that the loss of a helpmate and caretaker is actually the culprit. Wives typically monitor their husbands’ diets, remind them to take their daily medications, and urge them to give up vices such as smoking and drinking (Umberson, Wortman, and Kessler, 1992). For many older men, wives often are their primary (or only) source of social support and integration; when a man loses his wife, he also loses an important connection to his social networks.</p>
