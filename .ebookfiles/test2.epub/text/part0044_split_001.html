<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Is Democracy Meaningless in the Face of Increasingly Powerful Bureaucratic Organizations?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Even in democracies such as the United States, government organizations hold enormous amounts of information about us, from records of our birth dates, schools attended, and jobs held, to data on income used for tax collecting and information for issuing driver’s licenses and allocating Social Security numbers. Because we don’t have access to the files of most government agencies, such surveillance activities can infringe on the principle of democracy.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The diminishing of democracy with the advance of modern forms of organization worried Weber a great deal (see also <a href="part0083_split_000.html#2F4UM0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 13</a>). What especially disturbed him was the prospect of rule by faceless bureaucrats. After all, Weber reasoned, bureaucracies are necessarily specialized and hierarchical. Those near the bottom of the organization inevitably carry out mundane tasks and have no power over what they do; power resides with those at the top. Weber’s student Robert Michels (1967; orig. 1911) invented a phrase: “Who says organization says oligarchy.” It has come to refer to this loss of power, in large-scale organizations and, more generally, in a society dominated by organizations. Michels called this concept the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-iron-law-of-oligarchy" href="part0044_split_004.html#iron-law-of-oligarchy">iron law of oligarchy</a>. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-oligarchy" href="part0044_split_004.html#oligarchy">Oligarchy</a> means “rule by the few.” According to Michels, the flow of power toward the top is an inevitable part of an increasingly bureaucratized world—hence the “iron law.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Was Michels right? It surely is true that large-scale organizations involve the centralizing of power. Yet there is reason to believe that the iron law of oligarchy is not quite as hard and fast as Michels claimed. The connections between oligarchy and bureaucratic centralization are more ambiguous than he supposed.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">First, unequal power is not just a function of size. Marked differences of power exist even in modest-sized groups. In a small business, for instance, in which the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_189" title="189"></span>activities of employees are directly visible to the directors, much tighter control might be exerted than in larger organizations. As organizations expand in size, power relationships often become looser. Those at the middle and lower levels may have little influence over policies forged at the top. However, because of the specialization and expertise involved in bureaucracy, people at the top may lose control over many of the administrative decisions made by those lower down.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In many modern organizations, power is often delegated downward from superiors to subordinates. The heads of huge corporations are so busy coordinating different departments, coping with crises, and analyzing budget and forecast figures that they have little time for original thinking. Consequently, they delegate consideration of policy issues to others, whose task is to develop proposals. Many corporate leaders admit that, for the most part, they simply accept the conclusions given to them.</p>
