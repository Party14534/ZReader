<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The concept of “audience segregation” helps us understand some of the dilemmas of electronic communication. Many people are very sensitive about having things sent to their business email address if they don’t want their coworkers or supervisors to know about them. Thus, they maintain different addresses for home (back region) and office (front region), a practice that is increasingly important because many companies have policies against sending personal email from a company’s computer.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Or consider the social situation of a copied message. You write a message to a friend asking her whether she prefers to go to the early show or the late show. You also tell your friend that you have a new boyfriend whom you hope she’ll like. She replies and copies the other people who are thinking of going to the movie, many of whom you never intended to tell about the new romance. Suddenly, the audience segregation you had imagined has broken down.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In recent years, undergraduate students have posted pictures of themselves drinking at parties, or even naked, only to discover that future employers conducted web searches before making hiring decisions. Some students have even found themselves expelled from their colleges for posting inappropriate Facebook photos or comments. For example, in April 2017, Harvard University rescinded admissions offers to at least 10 students who circulated offensive memes within a private Facebook group for prospective Harvard students. Another example of blurring audiences is the case of sexting; a high school student may send a revealing photo of herself to her boyfriend, only to have him forward it to the entire school—whether out of cruelty or by mistake. Personal catastrophes such as these, and ones far worse, occur frequently in the age of email and smartphones.</p>
