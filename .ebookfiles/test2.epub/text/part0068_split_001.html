<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Gendered Inequalities in Education: Unequal Treatment in the Classroom</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists have found that schools help foster gender differences in outlook and behavior. In the past, school regulations compelling girls to wear dresses or skirts served as an obvious means of gender typing. The consequences went beyond mere appearance. As a result of their clothes, girls lacked the freedom to sit casually, to join in rough-and-tumble games, or to run as fast as they were able. Although strict enforcement of school dress has become rare, differences in informal styles of dress persist, still influencing gender behavior in school.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">School reading texts also perpetuate gender images. Although this, too, is changing, storybooks and coloring books used in elementary school often portray boys showing initiative and independence, and girls being more passive and watching their brothers. Stories written especially for girls often have an element of adventure, but usually in a domestic or school setting. Boys’ adventure stories are more wide-ranging, with heroes who travel to distant places or who, in other ways, are sturdily independent (Fitzpatrick and McPherson, 2010; Statham, 1986).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In general, people interact differently with men and women, and boys and girls (Lorber, 1994)—even in elementary schools. Studies document that teachers interact differently, and often inequitably, with male and female students in terms of the frequency and content of teacher-student interactions. Such patterns are based on, and perpetuate, traditional assumptions about male and female behavior and traits. One study showed that, regardless of the sex of the teacher, male students interact more with their teachers than female students do. Boys receive more teacher attention and instructional time than girls do. This is partly because boys are more demanding than girls (American Association of University Women [AAUW], 1992). Another study reported that boys are eight times more likely to call out answers in class, thus grabbing their teachers’ attention, and that even when boys do not voluntarily participate in class, teachers are more likely to solicit information from them than from girls. However, when girls try to bring attention to themselves by calling out in class without raising their hands, they are reprimanded (Sadker and Sadker, 1994).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In addition, the content of teacher-student interactions differs depending on the sex of the students. For example, the assumption that girls are bad at math may lead teachers to shy away from engaging girls in discussion during math class, ultimately perpetuating girls’ insecurity about <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_347" title="347"></span>their ability to succeed at this subject (Gunderson et al., 2011). After observing elementary school teachers and students over many years, researchers found that teachers helped boys in working out the correct answers, whereas they simply gave girls the correct answers and did not engage them in the problem-solving process. In addition, teachers posed more academic challenges to boys, encouraging them to think through their answers to find the best possible response (Sadker and Sadker, 1994).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Boys were also disadvantaged in important ways, however. Because of their rowdy behavior, they were more often scolded and punished than the female students. Moreover, boys outnumber girls in special education programs by startling percentages. Sociologists have argued that school personnel may be mislabeling boys’ behavioral problems as learning disabilities. These patterns can have long-term effects; punishment, especially the most severe forms, such as school suspension, are linked with poorer grades, lower graduation rates, and ultimately poorer prospects for gainful employment (e.g., Shollenberger, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The ways that gendered stereotypes and expectations hurt boys and girls are even more harmful for African American children, underscoring the importance of intersectionality. A study of what it was like to be a Black female pupil in a White school reported that while the Black girls were, like the boys, initially enthusiastic about school, they altered their attitudes because of the difficulties they encountered. Even when the girls were young, age seven or eight, teachers would disperse them if they <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_348" title="348"></span>were chatting in a group on the playground, while tolerating similar behavior among White children. Once treated as “troublemakers,” the Black girls rapidly became so (Bryan et al., 1987). Other work shows that Black girls were reprimanded more than Black boys or White girls for talking loudly, as such behavior was not considered appropriately feminine. As sociologist Edward Morris (2007) found in his study of elementary school classrooms, Black girls’ manners were occasionally criticized by teachers, who would refer to outspoken girls as “loudies” rather than “ladies.” Racial differences in how girls are treated emerge as young as preschool. A recent Department of Education (2014) study found that Black girls are suspended or expelled at a rate six times higher than that of White girls: Fully 12 percent of Black preschool-age girls (but just 2 percent of their White peers) received an out-of-school suspension.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Similar racial gaps emerge among boys, albeit for different reasons. Black boys are more likely than White boys to be disciplined harshly, consistent with stereotypes that equate Black masculinity with aggression. As with girls, these Black-White disparities start in preschool. The Department of Education study found that 20 percent of Black preschool-age boys (but just 6 percent of White preschool boys) received an out-of-school suspension. Black boys in elementary, middle, and high school also are more likely than any other subgroup of students to be physically restrained and even referred to law enforcement for misbehavior. Experts attribute these strong disciplinary reactions to stereotypes about race and masculinity, and to the fact that young Black boys are viewed as older than they actually are. One fascinating study concluded that “Black boys [are] seen as responsible for their actions at an age when White boys still benefit from the assumption that children are essentially innocent” (Goff et al., 2014).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">The Gendering of College Majors</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">College is a time of exploration, when students take both general-education classes and specialized classes within their chosen major that prepare them for a career after graduation. Men and women differ starkly in the majors they choose, opting for fields that are consistent with gender-typed socialization; women focus on fields associated with caring and nurturing, whereas men tend to pursue fields that emphasize logic and analysis. Yet the majors women tend to choose are precisely those fields that garner the lowest earnings after graduation, whereas men are channeled into majors with high economic returns.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A research study by Glassdoor (2017) that spanned a seven-year time period, from 2010 to 2017, found that women dominated college majors such as social work (85 percent), healthcare administration (84 percent), nursing (80 percent), and education (66 percent). By contrast, men dominated engineering fields such as mechanical engineering (89 percent), civil engineering (83 percent), and computer science and engineering (74 percent).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Feminist scholars note that this stark gender segregation among college majors is one important reason for the persistent gender gap in pay. Glassdoor (2018) ranked college majors based on median base salary and found that social work (median annual salary $41,656), health care administration ($42,000), and education ($43,000) were among the lowest-ranked. Comparatively, engineering fields dominated heavily <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_349" title="349"></span>by men drew a median base salary of between $61,000 (civil engineering) and $68,438 (electrical engineering).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Research on how young people choose their majors consistently shows that subtle forces, including input from parents, friends, and guidance counselors; a lack of same-sex role models; active encouragement (or discouragement) from teachers; and limited exposure to particular fields of study tend to channel women into “female-typed” majors and men into “male-typed” majors (Morgan et al., 2013; Porter and Umbach, 2006).</p>
