<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Since the mid-1970s, the overall standard of living in the world has generally risen. Illiteracy is down, infant deaths and malnutrition are less common, people are living longer, and average income is higher. Does this higher standard of living mean that global poverty is being eliminated, or that inequality within nations—or, for that matter, between nations—is declining? What is the future of inequality in our rapidly globalizing world?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are no clear-cut answers to any of these questions, perhaps because during a time of rapid change, it is difficult to assess accurately the social forces at play, even with the tools of social science. The debates, however, are informative and have produced some useful explanations, even if agreement is lacking.</p>
