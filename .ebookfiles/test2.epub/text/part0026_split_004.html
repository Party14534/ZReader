<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">How Easily Do Cultures Change?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 1922, one of sociology’s early founders, William F. Ogburn, introduced the notion of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-cultural-lag" href="part0026_split_005.html#cultural-lag">cultural lag</a>—the idea that cultural changes take time to catch up with changes in technology, resulting in challenges for societies undergoing rapid transformation (Ogburn, 1964). In the modern world, changes in material culture precede changes in nonmaterial culture, often resulting in a host of social problems. For example, recent advances in synthetic biology, such as gene editing, have made it relatively easy (and inexpensive) to alter specific genes, opening up the possibility of creating new life forms with unique (and presumably desirable) properties.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One experiment, currently under serious consideration, involves altering the genes in thousands of white-footed mice on Nantucket Island, rendering them resistant to Lyme disease. Once altered, the mice would spread the gene to the offspring of the roughly one million mice on the island, eventually eradicating a disease that afflicts many of the island’s residents. Gene editing could also be used to create a strain of malaria-resistant mosquitoes, thereby eliminating an illness that kills hundreds of thousands of children every year. It might even be used, in the perhaps not-so-distant future, to design human offspring—children who excel as students, athletes, or musicians (Specter, 2017; Ledford, 2016)!</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Gene-editing techniques may hold great promise, but “rewriting the code of life” (as it has been described) raises a host of ethical questions. Apart from the possibility of disastrous unintended consequences, such as the creation of new Frankenstein-like species that bring unknown dangers, gene editing is seen by some as playing God, a violation of widely shared values (McFadden, 2016). Such concerns have led the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Medicine to develop guidelines for modifying human genes (Reardon, 2015). Scientific knowledge has, in this case, greatly outstripped long-standing values, which may well slow the adoption of this new technology.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">China, which has undergone a transformation in recent years that is in many ways historically unprecedented, provides another illustration of cultural lag. Thirty years ago, China was completely closed to foreign businesses. Government bureaucrats, who controlled every economic institution, ran its economy. From large factories to small businesses to collective farms—all were owned and run by the state. The Chinese government also sought to control most aspects of Chinese culture: Media were state run, education was tightly managed to promote values that the ruling Communist Party deemed appropriate, and any signs of disagreement were closely monitored and often punished. Wall posters would denounce behavior that deviated from acceptable norms, while many universities and public places had loudspeaker systems that would frequently broadcast inspirational messages or criticize bad behavior.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, China appears to be a vastly different place, especially in the more developed coastal and large metropolitan areas. While some key industries remain state owned, most of the economy is now in private hands. European, American, Japanese, and other foreign firms are flocking to China in large numbers, bringing with them the cultural values of their home countries. China’s rapidly growing economy has lifted hundreds of millions of people into middle-class status, turning them into consumers not only of products but also of information. China now claims more than 1.5 billion cell phone users (Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, 2018), opening up many Chinese to foreign sources of information and culture. Although the Chinese <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_92" title="92"></span>government still censors search engines, websites, blogs, and Twitter feeds it deems critical of central government policies, a great deal of dissent is now tolerated. Importantly, many Chinese are now exposed to cultural norms and values that 30 years ago were considered unthinkable.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Have these changes significantly altered Chinese culture so that it is becoming more Western? While superficially this may seem to be the case, in some ways, traditional Chinese culture has remained remarkably durable. Take one example: instilling in China’s leading scientists and engineers a strong cultural value for the kinds of innovative thinking that can lead to technological breakthroughs. In the United States, such thinking is highly culturally valued. One result in the business world has been the creation of such innovative brands as Apple, Facebook, and Twitter. Such brands often achieve worldwide cachet—so much so that after the iPhones 6 and 6 Plus were introduced in October 2014, Apple was forced to divert stock from India to better meet the demand in China, which is one of its fastest-growing markets (Mukherjee, 2014; Chen, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">To date, China’s economic growth has been based largely on manufacturing and assembling products for foreign firms, rather than innovating new brands that capture global markets. Chinese scientists and engineers are known for their strong work ethic—for putting in long hours at diligent labor in their effort to innovate. Yet, thus far, the results have been mainly improving on foreign designs, rather than developing truly unique Chinese breakthroughs. During the past decade, the Chinese government has sought to change this situation. It has invested vast sums of money in higher education and science parks in the hope of spurring technological breakthroughs that will result in Chinese brand-name products that consumers the world over will want to buy. Yet, so far, these efforts have not succeeded. Why haven’t they?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are many reasons, but one has to do with a long-standing cultural tradition emphasizing the importance of memorization and rote learning, which produces stunning results on standardized tests but discourages the kind of “outside-the-box,” more analytical thinking that can contribute to truly innovative breakthroughs (Wilsdon and Keeley, 2007). The Chinese cultural value that emphasizes test-taking as the key measure of one’s ability dates back to the sixth and seventh centuries, when entrance into prestigious government jobs was first based on passing a difficult examination (Miyazaki, 1981). Every year, millions of Chinese students now take the dreaded two- to three-day exam known as the <i class="italic">gaokao</i>, which determines not only whether they will go to college, but also what college they will go to, and, ultimately, their life prospects. Hopeful parents often hire expensive private tutors, and students spend months (if not years) in preparation (Sudworth, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As a result, Chinese students do extraordinarily well when tested. In 2012, on a standardized test administered to over half a million fifteen-year-olds in sixty-five countries, Chinese students scored higher than students from any other country on science, reading, and math. U.S. students, by way of comparison, ranked twentieth in science, seventeenth in reading, and twenty-seventh in math (OECD, 2014b). Yet despite their superior performance, Chinese students do not often come up with creative, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_93" title="93"></span>breakthrough ideas after they graduate, whether in the laboratory or in business (Parker and Appelbaum, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In an effort to change this situation, the Chinese government recently instituted an educational reform plan calling for more flexible college admissions policies modeled, in part, on the U.S. approach; letters of recommendation and extracurricular activities are now supposed to be considered (Wang, 2010; <i class="italic">Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, 2010). There is little evidence, however, that such official edicts have had any effect on students’ relentless preparation for the <i class="italic">gaokao</i> or on college admissions committees’ decisions.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Cultural beliefs and practices that have been in existence for nearly 1,500 years do not change easily.</p>
