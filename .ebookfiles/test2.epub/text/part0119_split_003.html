<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Are Eating Disorders Primarily a “Women’s” Problem?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We learned earlier in this chapter that one of the most serious concerns threatening the health of Americans today is the obesity epidemic. Yet as college students, you may notice that some of your classmates are dieting or exercising excessively, striving to look like the models gracing the covers of fashion magazines such as <i class="italic">Vogue</i> or <i class="italic">Men’s Health</i>. You may think that another equally important body-weight issue faces our nation: excessive slenderness and eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia. These are serious social problems, and ones that disproportionately strike women—but why? And why are young men increasingly monitoring their calorie intake, upping their time at the gym, or even turning to steroids in the hopes of having “Adonis”-like physiques (Pope, Phillips, and Olivardia, 2002)?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It’s important first to step back and consider the history of such conditions. Anorexia, an eating disorder characterized by extreme food restriction and an irrational fear of gaining weight, is thought of as a contemporary social problem, but the condition was first identified as a disorder in France in 1874. It remained obscure until the past 30 or 40 years and has since become increasingly common among young women (Brown and Jasper, 1993). So has bulimia—bingeing on large portions of food, followed by self-induced vomiting. Anorexia and bulimia often occur in the same individual. A recent study estimates that 1.3 million women and 450,000 men suffer from anorexia, 2.25 million women and 750,000 men suffer from bulimia, and 5.25 million women and 3 million men suffer from binge eating. A total of 30 million Americans, or about 9 percent of the population, suffer from one or more forms of eating disorders (Eating Disorders Coalition [EDC], 2009; National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any psychological disorder; 20 percent of anorexics will die from it (EDC, 2009). Once a young person starts to diet and exercise compulsively, she can become locked into a pattern of refusing food or vomiting up what she has eaten. As the body loses muscle mass, it loses heart muscle, so the heart gets smaller and weaker, which ultimately leads to heart failure. About half of all anorexics also have low white blood cell counts, and about a third are anemic. Both conditions can lower the immune system’s resistance to disease, leaving an anorexic vulnerable to infections. However, these harmful patterns may be broken through psychotherapy and medical treatment.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These harmful consequences are particularly devastating when one considers that the occurrence of eating disorders in the United States has doubled since 1960 (EDC, 2009). Over 80 percent of 10-year-old children are afraid of being fat (EDC, 2003). About 95 percent of U.S. college women say they want to lose weight, and up <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_754" title="754"></span>to 85 percent suffer serious problems with eating disorders during their college years. Around 25 percent experience bulimic episodes or anorexia. In American society, 60 percent of girls age 13 have already begun to diet; this proportion rises to over 80 percent for women age 18. College men suffer similar experiences, but to a lesser extent. About 50 percent of American male college students want to lose weight, while about 30 percent are on diets (Hesse-Biber, 1997).</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">An anorexic woman (right) has starved herself thin; people suffering from anorexia feel compelled to lose weight by a variety of social and personal pressures, often continuing to view themselves as overweight even when they have reached a state of emaciation. Eating disorders are unlikely to disappear as long as severely underweight fashion models and actresses (left) are upheld as paragons of beauty.</figcaption>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Obsession with slenderness—and the resulting eating disorders—extends beyond the United States and Europe. Fashion magazines today regularly feature images of models who are severely underweight, yet are upheld as paragons of beauty. The average fashion model today is 23 percent thinner than the average American woman; 25 years ago, that number was 8 percent (Derenne and Beresin, 2006). As Western images of feminine beauty have spread to the rest of the world, so have associated illnesses. Eating problems also have surfaced among young, primarily affluent women in Hong Kong and Singapore, and in urban areas in China, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Taiwan (Efron, 1997).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Given how harmful eating disorders are, why do they persist, and why do they affect young women more than either young men or older women? Although roughly 10 <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_755" title="755"></span>percent of those with eating disorders are men, they don’t suffer from anorexia or bulimia as often as women—partly because social norms stress the importance of physical attractiveness more for women than for men, and partly because desirable body images of men differ from those of women. Anorexia and other eating disorders reflect the fact that women now play a larger part in the wider society but are still judged as much by their appearance as by their accomplishments. Eating disorders are rooted in feelings of shame and a desire to have control over one’s body. The individual feels inadequate and imperfect, and her anxieties about how others perceive her become focused through feelings about her body. At that point, shedding weight becomes the means of making everything right in her world. Sociologists believe that as long as young women are raised to equate their self-worth with their physical appearance, eating disorders will persist.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Just as young women often struggle to maintain a slender physique, young men increasingly struggle to maintain a taut, muscular body, a phenomenon called the Adonis complex (Pope et al., 2002). A small yet significant number of young men may limit their calories, become addicted to exercise, especially weight-lifting, or may turn to anabolic-androgenic steroids to achieve a physique equated with the cultural “ideal” image of masculinity. One recent study of more than 2,000 high school students found that boys who considered themselves “small” or “skinny” were more likely to use steroids and to suffer from poor body image (e.g., Blashill and Wilhelm, 2014; Blashill, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Cultural pressures to comply with gender-typed body ideals have potential lethal consequences since both anorexia and steroid use are linked with heart problems, even among adolescents (Achar, Rostamanian, and Narayan, 2010). In this way, our bodies are powerfully shaped by gendered cultural expectations (Wienke, 1998).</p>
