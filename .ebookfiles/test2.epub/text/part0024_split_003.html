<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Industrial Societies</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What happened to destroy the forms of society that dominated the whole of history up to two centuries ago? The answer, in a word, is <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-industrialization" href="part0024_split_004.html#industrialization">industrialization</a>—the emergence of machine production based on the use of inanimate power resources (such as steam or electricity). The industrialized, or modern, societies differ from any previous type of social order in several key respects, and their development has had consequences stretching far beyond their European origins.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Industrialization originated in eighteenth-century Britain as a result of the Industrial Revolution, a complex set of technological changes between 1750 and 1850 that affected people’s means of gaining a livelihood. These changes included the invention of new machines (such as the spinning jenny for creating yarn, patented in 1770), the harnessing of power resources (especially water and steam) for production, and the use of science to improve production methods. Because discoveries and inventions in one field lead to more in others, the pace of technological innovation in <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-industrialized-societies" href="part0024_split_004.html#industrialized-societies">industrialized societies</a> is extremely rapid compared with that of traditional social systems.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In even the most advanced of traditional civilizations, most people worked on the land. By contrast, in industrialized societies today, the majority of the employed population works in factories, offices, or shops. And slightly more than half of all people (55 percent) live and work in urban areas (United Nations, 2018). The largest cities are vastly larger than the urban settlements of traditional civilizations. In cities, social life becomes impersonal and anonymous, and many encounters are with strangers. Large-scale organizations, such as business corporations or government agencies, influence the lives of virtually everyone.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The political systems of modern societies are more developed than forms of government in traditional states; in the latter, monarchs and emperors had little influence on the customs of most of their subjects, who lived in self-contained villages. With industrialization, transportation and communication became much more rapid, promoting a more integrated “national” community.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The industrialized societies were the first <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-nation-states" href="part0024_split_004.html#nation-states">nation-states</a>—political communities with clearly delimited borders and shared culture, rather than vague frontier areas that separated traditional states. Nation-state governments have extensive powers over many aspects of citizens’ lives, framing laws that apply to all those living within their borders. The United States is a nation-state, as are virtually all other societies in the world today.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The application of industrial technology not only has served peaceful processes of economic development but also has altered <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_73" title="73"></span>ways of waging war, creating weaponry and modes of military organization much more advanced than those of nonindustrial cultures. Together, superior economic strength, political cohesion, and military superiority account for the worldwide spread of Western culture over the past two centuries.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociology first emerged as a discipline as industrial societies developed in Europe and North America, and it was strongly influenced by the changes taking place at that time. As we saw in <a href="part0009_split_000.html#8IL20-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 1</a>, the major nineteenth-century sociological theorists (Durkheim, Marx, and Weber) all sought to explain these sweeping changes. While they differed in their understanding and their predictions about the future, all shared a belief that industrial society was here to stay, and, as a result, the future would in many ways resemble the past.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For Durkheim, this vision of the future meant the increasing importance of what he termed “organic solidarity”—a growing division of labor, with all members of society engaged in highly specialized roles (or <i class="italic">functions</i>, in Durkheim’s terminology), with functional interdependence resulting in ties that bind the members of society together. Marx, on the other hand, argued that industrial society’s division into social classes hampered its technological potential because the capitalist class reaped all the benefits of advanced technologies at the expense of the working class. In his view, a working-class revolution was required to create a classless society, a new form of industrial society in which everyone prospered. Weber focused on the rise of what he termed <i class="italic">rational-legal society</i>, best seen in modern bureaucracies. This he viewed as a highly efficient form of social organization that was, unfortunately, simultaneously destructive of human freedom and potential—or, as he referred to it in his memorable phrase, an “iron cage.” While Weber anticipated that from time to time charismatic leaders might emerge to challenge this trend, ultimately their power would become routinized, and the long march of the bureaucrat would continue.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While Durkheim, Marx, and Weber’s theoretical understanding of the emerging industrial society still has relevance, contemporary theorists have shed new light on the ways in which culture and society are changing in the modern world. We’re experiencing a transition to a new type of society that is no longer based primarily on manufacturing or low-paying service work, but rather relies increasingly on information technology, artificial intelligence, and robotics to replace human labor in a growing range of jobs—from unskilled labor slinging hamburgers to the highly skilled work of engineers, accountants, and other professionals. We are entering, in other words, a “postindustrial” society, a topic we will discuss in detail in <a href="part0090_split_000.html#2LQIK0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 14</a>. In the next section of this chapter, we consider recent research on some of the current issues that confront global societies.</p>
