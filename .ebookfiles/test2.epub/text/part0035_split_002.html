<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Audience Segregation</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although people cooperate to help one another “save face,” they also endeavor individually to preserve their own dignity, autonomy, and respect. One of the ways in which people do this is by arranging for “audience segregation” in their lives. In each of their roles, they act somewhat differently, and they try to keep what they do in each role distinct from what they do in their other roles. This means that they can have multiple selves. Frequently, these selves are consistent with one another, but sometimes, they are not. People find it very stressful when boundaries break down or when they cannot reconcile their role in one area of their life with their role in another.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For example, we may have two friends who do not like each other. Rather than choose between them, we will spend time with both friends but never mention to either friend that we are close with the other. Or some people live very different lives at home and at work. For example, due to discrimination against gays and lesbians, someone who appears “straight” at work may live happily with a same-sex partner at home. Like all people who engage in audience segregation, they show a different face to different people.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Audience segregation implicitly encourages impression management. Some people maintain two different Facebook pages, one linked to family members or coworkers and another linked to friends and peers. Why might someone do this? Our Facebook pages are a strategy to “impression manage,” or to carefully and selectively portray an image of ourselves to the outside world. On your “professional” page, you might try to convey an image of a respectable student and employee by carefully curating the information and images you post. By contrast, on your personal page, you might post photos that present a more fun and carefree version of yourself.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Goffman saw social life as a precarious balancing act, but he also studied those instances in which audience segregation could not be maintained. He conducted an ethnographic study of St. Elizabeth’s, a mental hospital in Washington, D.C., described in his book <i class="italic">Asylums</i>. St. Elizabeth’s was a place where the barriers among different spheres of life (sleep, play, and work) did not exist. In such an environment, which Goffman called a “total institution,” human beings need to adapt to the fact that their <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_139" title="139"></span>private spheres are limited. Other examples of “total institutions,” in which all aspects of life are conducted in the same place, include prisons, monasteries, and army boot camps.</p>
