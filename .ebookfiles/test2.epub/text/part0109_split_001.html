<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">How Sociologists Think about Religion</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When sociologists study religion, they do so as unbiased scientists and not as believers (or disbelievers) in any particular faith. This stance has a number of implications:</p>
<ul class="contents">
<li class="bcpt"><span><b class="bold1">Sociologists are not concerned with whether religious beliefs are true or false.</b> The sociological perspective regards religions as socially constructed by human beings. Thus, sociologists put aside their personal beliefs and address the human, rather than the divine, aspects of religion. Sociologists ask: How is the religion organized? What are its principal beliefs and values? How is it related to the larger society? What explains its success or failure in recruiting and retaining believers? The question of whether a particular belief is “good” or “true” is not something that sociologists can address. (As individuals, they may have strong opinions on the matter, but as sociologists, they must keep these opinions from biasing their research.)</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span><b class="bold1">Sociologists are especially concerned with the social organization of religion.</b> Not only are religions a primary source of the deepest-seated norms and values, but they are practiced through an enormous variety of social forms. Within Christianity and Judaism, for example, religious practice often occurs in formal organizations, such as churches or synagogues. Yet within Hinduism and Buddhism, religious practices occur in the home as well as in temples or other natural settings. The sociology of religion considers how different religious institutions and organizations actually function. The earliest European religions were often indistinguishable from the larger society since beliefs and practices were incorporated into daily life. In modern industrial society, however, some religions have become established in separate, often bureaucratic, organizations (Hammond, 1992). This institutionalization has led some <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_657" title="657"></span>sociologists to view religions in the United States and Europe as similar to business organizations, competing with one another for members (Warner, 1993).</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span><b class="bold1">Sociologists have often viewed religions as a major source of social solidarity in that they offer believers a common set of norms and values.</b> Religious beliefs, rituals, and bonds create a “moral community” in which all members know how to behave (Wuthnow, 1988). If a single religion dominates a society, the religion may be an important source of social solidarity—although it may also be oppressive if, like the Taliban, it requires absolute conformity to a particular set of beliefs and punishes those who deviate.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span><b class="bold1">If a society’s members adhere to competing religions, religious differences may lead to destabilizing social conflicts.</b> Recent examples of religious conflict within a society include struggles among Sikhs, Hindus, and Muslims in India; clashes between Muslims and Christians in Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia; conflicts between Shiite and Sunni Muslims in Iraq; and hate crimes against Jews, Muslims, and other religious minorities in the United States.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span><b class="bold1">Sociologists explain the appeal of religion in terms of social forces rather than personal, spiritual, or psychological factors.</b> Sociologists do not question the depth of believers’ transcendent feelings and experiences, yet they also do not limit themselves to a purely spiritual explanation of religious commitment. In fact, some researchers argue that people often turn to, or “get,” religion when their fundamental sense of social order is threatened by economic hardship, loneliness, loss or grief, physical suffering, or poor health (Berger, 1967; Glock, 1976; Schwartz, 1970; Stark and Bainbridge, 1980). In explaining the appeal of religious movements, sociologists are more likely to focus on problems in the social order than on the individual’s psychological response.</span></li>
