<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We have described the ways in which macrosocial factors such as social class and school organization, as well as microsocial processes such as stereotype threat and stereotype promise, may account for educational inequalities. However, a third set of factors also has a powerful influence on student outcomes: public policies.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Educational Reform in the United States</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociological research has played a major role in reforming the educational system. These reforms, in turn, have had a powerful impact on the lives of children who are affected by such policies. The object of James Coleman’s research, commissioned as part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, was not solely academic; it was undertaken to influence policy—and it succeeded. On the basis of the act, the courts decided that segregated schools violated the rights of minority pupils. But rather than attacking the origins of educational inequalities directly, as Christopher Jencks’s later work suggested was necessary, the courts decided that the schools in each district should achieve a similar racial balance. Thus began the practice of busing students to other schools.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">In 1970, a U.S. judge in North Carolina ordered that Black students be bused to White schools and that White students be bused to Black schools. It was hoped that this crosstown school busing would end the de facto segregation of public schools caused by White students living in predominantly White neighborhoods and Black students living in predominantly Black neighborhoods.</figcaption>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Busing provoked a great deal of opposition, particularly from parents and children in White areas, and led to episodes of violence at the gates of schools where the children were bused in from other neighborhoods. White children paraded with placards reading, “We don’t want them!” Still, busing met with a good deal of success, reducing levels of school segregation quite steeply, particularly in the South. But busing also produced a number of unintended consequences. Some White parents reacted to busing either by putting their children into private schools or moving to mainly White suburbs where busing wasn’t practiced. As a result, in the cities, some schools are virtually as segregated as the old schools had been in the past. Busing, however, was only one factor prompting the “White flight” to the suburbs. Whites also left as a reaction to urban decay: to escape city crowding, housing problems, and rising crime rates.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One important target of educational policy today is improving levels of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-functional-literacy" href="part0105_split_006.html#functional-literacy">functional literacy</a>. Literacy is more than the ability to read and write; literacy is also the ability to process complex information in our <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_633" title="633"></span>increasingly technology-focused society. The National Center for Education Statistics breaks literacy into three components: prose literacy, document literacy, and quantitative literacy. Prose literacy means that a person can look at a short piece of text to get a small piece of uncomplicated information. Document literacy refers to a person’s ability to locate and use information in forms, schedules, charts, graphs, and other informational tables. Quantitative literacy is the ability to do simple addition. In the United States today, only 13 percent of the population is proficient in these three areas (Kutner et al., 2007). Of course, the United States is a country of immigrants, who, when they arrive, may not be able to read and write, and who may also have trouble with English. But this doesn’t explain why the United States has higher levels of functional illiteracy than most other industrial countries; many functionally illiterate people are not recent immigrants at all.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What is to be done? Some educators have argued that the most important change that needs to be made is to improve the quality of teaching, either by increasing teachers’ pay or introducing performance-related pay scales, with higher salaries going to the teachers who are most effective in the classroom. Others have proposed giving schools more control over their budgets (a reform that Britain has implemented). The idea is that more responsibility for, and control over, budgeting decisions will create a greater drive to improve the school. Further proposals include the re-funding of federal programs such as Head Start to ensure healthy early-child development and thus save millions of dollars in later costs. Others have called for the privatization of public education, a proposal that has gained numerous supporters in recent years, including President Trump’s Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Education Policy Today</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Education has long been a political battleground. In the 1960s, some politicians, educators, and community activists pushed for greater equality and universal access to education through such initiatives as bilingual education programs, multicultural education, open admissions to college, the establishment of ethnic studies programs on campuses, and more equitable funding schemes. Such initiatives were seen as supporting civil rights and equality. Educational policies in the twenty-first century have similarly intended to provide quality education for all children and to close the achievement gap. However, scholars disagree about how successful recent policies have been in meeting this goal.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The most significant piece of federal legislation influencing education in the past two decades is the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act enacted by Congress in 2001 and signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2002. NCLB reauthorized the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act but also expanded it by implementing a host of policies meant to improve academic outcomes for all children and close the achievement gap. Indeed, NCLB is the most expansive and comprehensive piece of education legislation passed since 1965, addressing virtually every aspect of education—including, for example, testing, school choice, teacher quality, the education of English language learners, military recruitment in schools, and school discipline. At the top of its agenda is instituting standardized testing as a means of measuring students’ academic performance. The Act also provides a strong push for school choice—that is, in the spirit of competition, parents are to be given choices about where to send their children to school. Low-performing schools, at risk of losing students, thus jeopardize their funding and risk being closed. Another significant implication of NCLB is that, for the first time since 1968, states are not required to offer non-English-speaking students bilingual education. Instead, the Act emphasizes learning English over using students’ native language and favors English-only program models. NCLB also provides support for a zero-tolerance approach to school discipline that was first mandated in the 1990 Gun-Free School Zone Act.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The NCLB has been widely criticized because teachers must “teach to the test.” Critics have argued that the emphasis on <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-standardized-testing" href="part0105_split_006.html#standardized-testing">standardized testing</a>—that is, where all students in a state take the same test under the same conditions—as the means of assessment encourages teachers to teach a narrow set of skills that will increase students’ test performance, rather than help them acquire an in-depth understanding of important concepts and skills (Hursh, 2007). Others have condemned the program as a punitive model of school reform (i.e., teachers and principals at underperforming schools risk job loss) and note that achievement gaps have not changed and that the policy neglects the important fact that the broader socioeconomic context affects school functioning.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 2012, recognizing that NCLB may not be effective for all school systems, President Barack Obama granted waivers from NCLB requirements to 32 states, allowing them to develop their own standards and exempting them from the 2014 targets set by the law. In exchange for that flexibility, those states “have agreed to raise standards, improve accountability, and undertake essential reforms to improve teacher effectiveness,” the White House said in a statement. The Obama administration also implemented its own program, called Race <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_635" title="635"></span>to the Top, a competitive grant program designed to spur innovation and reform in K-12 education. The program rewards states that demonstrate improvements in student outcomes, including closing achievement gaps, increasing graduation rates, and better preparing students for college. States competing for the more than $4 billion in grant money had to outline plans for developing and adopting common standards and assessments; building data systems that track student growth; recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers and administrators; and improving the lowest-achieving schools.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Like NCLB, however, Race to the Top has been roundly criticized for relying too heavily on high-stakes testing and also failing to address the true causes of low student achievement, namely poverty and lack of opportunity. Teachers’ unions and educators have also complained that the tests are an inaccurate way to measure teachers, and that such measures haven’t worked in the past. Political conservatives say that Race to the Top imposes federal control on state schools. Critics say that high-stakes testing is unreliable, that charter schools weaken public education, or that the federal government should not influence local schools (Dillon, 2010).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The crisis in American schools won’t be solved in the short term, and it won’t be solved by educational reforms alone, no matter how expansive. In fact, a 2006 study by the U.S. Department of Education found that schools identified for improvement were disproportionately urban, high-poverty schools, and that “school poverty and district size better predicted existing improvement status than the improvement strategies undertaken by the schools.” A further unintended consequence of the current emphasis on testing is that schools have narrowed their course offerings to focus much more heavily on tested subject areas while cutting time in science, social studies, music, art, and physical education (McMurrer, 2007).</p>

<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_636" title="636"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The lesson of sociological research is that inequalities and barriers in educational opportunity reflect wider social divisions and tensions. While the United States remains wracked by racial tensions, and the polarization between decaying cities and affluent suburbs persists, the crisis in the school system is likely to prove difficult to turn around. Jean Anyon’s (2006) analysis of how political and economic forces influence schooling helps clarify these challenges. Anyon argues that not until educational reform is linked to more sweeping economic reforms, such as job creation and training programs and corporate tax reform, will schools improve.</p>
