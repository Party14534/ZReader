<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Why Is Voter Turnout So Low in the United States?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Since the early 1960s, voter turnout in the United States has generally decreased, although recent elections suggest a possible reversal of that trend. In the 1960 presidential election, 64 percent of the eligible voting-age population turned out to vote; by the year 2000, that figure had dropped to 56 percent. In the 2016 presidential elections, voter turnout was slightly higher, at around 60 percent. The reasons for these small increases are not clear, although higher-than-usual youth turnout, mobilized by Rock the Vote and other organizations, and (in 2008 and 2012, the appeal of Barack Obama to young voters) undoubtedly accounts for part. The turnout for midterm congressional elections is usually only around 40 percent (U.S. Elections Project, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are significant differences in voter turnout by race and ethnicity, age, educational attainment, and income. In the 2016 election, only 61 percent of the citizen voting-age population bothered to vote. Turnout was highest among non-Hispanic Whites (65 percent), somewhat lower for Blacks (60 percent), and considerably lower for Hispanics (48 percent). Turnout also varied considerably with age, with older citizens voting at much higher rates than younger adults: 71 percent of eligible citizens 65 and older turned out to vote, compared with 67 percent of adults between the ages of 45 and 64, 59 percent of adults ages 30 to 44, and only 46 percent of adults ages 18 to 29 (File, 2017). Education also influences voting behavior: In the 2016 presidential election, 35 percent of persons who lacked a high school diploma turned out to vote, compared with 76 percent of those with bachelor’s degrees or higher. Turnout was just 48 percent among voters whose family income was less than $30,000, rising to 78 percent among voters whose family income was over $100,000 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2017n).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Voter turnout in the United States is among the world’s lowest. Many studies have found that countries with high rates of literacy, high average incomes, and well-established political freedoms and civil liberties have high voter turnout (International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance [IIDEA], 2004). Even though the United States ranks high on all these measures, it fails to motivate people to vote. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_496" title="496"></span>The United States ranks 31st in voter turnout among the 35 advanced industrial countries that belong to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes the United States, Japan, Israel, most European countries, and such emerging economies as Chile, Turkey, and Korea. Voting is compulsory for six OECD countries, but that alone cannot account for the United States’ low ranking (25 OECD countries that do not legally require people to vote still outrank the United States; Desilver, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Why is voter turnout so low in the United States? While there are no clear-cut answers to this question, a number of factors undoubtedly play a role. First, in the United States—unlike in many other countries—voter registration is not automatic. Many people find the process of registering to vote burdensome, and so don’t bother. While 15 states permit people to register the same day they vote, most do not. One study found that same-day registration resulted in somewhat higher voter turnout (Burden et al., 2013). Education also makes a difference—as we have seen, more highly educated people are more likely to vote.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another factor is winner-take-all elections, which discourage the formation of third parties. As a result, voters may feel a lack of viable choices; a large (and growing) number of people clearly feel that the current system is unresponsive to their needs. This was an important factor in the rise of populism in the 2016 presidential campaigns, with Sanders and Trump—both rejecting “business as usual”—attracting the most enthusiastic support among dedicated followers. In many countries, including most European countries, some system of proportional representation is practiced, under which parties receive seats in proportion to the vote they get in electoral districts. Thus, for example, if a district has 10 seats in parliament, and the Conservative Party gets 30 percent of the vote, that district would send three Conservative representatives to parliament. Under this system, even small parties can often muster sufficient support to elect one or two representatives. When voters have a wider range of choices, they are more likely to vote.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Finally, in some states, significant barriers have been raised to make it more difficult for some people to vote, including so-called voter ID laws, which require a driver’s license, a birth certificate, or some other form of photo identification to vote. Voter ID laws have proliferated in recent years, and as of 2020 (as well as for the 2016 election cycle), 10 states required photo identification in order to vote. These laws are most likely to affect low-income and minority voters (Hajnal, Lajevardi, and Nielson, 2017; Highton, 2017; NCLS, 2020).</p>
