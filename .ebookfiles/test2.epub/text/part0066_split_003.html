<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">The Social Construction of Gender: How We Learn to “Do Gender”</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Recently, a growing number of sociologists have criticized socialization and gender role socialization theories. Rather than seeing sex as biologically determined and gender as culturally learned, they argue that both sex and gender are socially constructed products. Not only is gender a purely social creation that lacks a fixed essence, but the human body itself is subject to social forces that shape and alter it in various ways.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Scholars who focus on gender roles and role learning accept that there is a biological basis for some gender differences. Adherents to socialization perspectives believe that the biological distinction between the sexes is the starting point for differences that become culturally elaborated and amplified in society. In contrast, theorists who believe in the social construction of gender reject all biological bases for gender differences.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Proponents of this view argue that gender is more than learning to act like a girl or boy; rather, it is something that we continually “do” in our daily interactions with others (West and Zimmerman, 1987). We learn how to present ourselves as “male” or “female” through our choice of behaviors, clothing, hairstyle, stance, body language, and even tone of voice. For example, a number of scholars have uncovered the discouraging finding that some young heterosexual women “play dumb” both because they believe it is consistent with gendered expectations for how girls should act and because they believe that doing so may help bolster the feelings of masculinity among the boys they are hoping to attract as romantic partners (Gove, Hughes, and Geerken, 1980). At the same time, young men feel great pressure to be strong, confident, and funny to attract a partner. As sociologist Maria do Mar Pereira discovered in her 2014 qualitative study of 14-year-old boys and girls, “Young people try to adapt their behavior according to these pressures to fit into society. One of the pressures is that young men must be more dominant—cleverer, stronger, taller, funnier—than young women, and that being in a relationship with a woman who is more intelligent will undermine their masculinity” (University of Warwick, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">But precisely how we “do gender” varies widely by race, social class, and social context. We selectively choose to enact different aspects of gender expectations based on what we think will work best in a particular setting. For example, sociologist Nikki Jones (2009) found that young inner-city African American women would adjust their voice, stance, walk, and style of speaking in different situations, thus giving off the impressions of being “aggressive,” “good,” or “pretty” when they thought a particular type of femininity would “pay off.” Jones described the ways that 22-year-old Kiara would “do gender.” Kiara was hoping to collect signatures for a petition to stop a new development in a poor neighborhood adjacent to her own. As Jones (2009) describes:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">[Kiara] confidently, assertively, even aggressively approaches men on the street to sign her petition and then draws on normative expectations of manhood and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_335" title="335"></span>femininity to encourage them to add their names to the list: Babies and women are in danger, she tells them, letting the implication that real men would sign up to protect babies and women hang in the air. She switches from aggressive to demure just long enough to flirt with a man passing by on the street and then to defiant when she passes the police station on the corner. “They don’t give a fuck!” she declares loudly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Kiara’s behavior shows the complexities of gendered expectations in contemporary social life.</p>
