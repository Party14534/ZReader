<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">How Will These Economic Patterns Affect Your Life?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sometime in the next few years, you will graduate from college and face the prospect of starting a career. Do you have any idea what you will do? Perhaps you will start your own business or work your way up the hierarchy of an organization in a formal career. Some of you may go to graduate school, take an unpaid internship, or volunteer for an organization such as the Peace Corps. After reading this chapter, have your hopes and plans changed in any way?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Research findings on social stratification and mobility may have important implications for your economic future. Managerial and professional jobs may continue to expand relative to lower-level positions. Those who have earned a college degree are most likely to fill these openings and make a high income. Indeed, 61 percent of Americans in the top fifth of income earners graduated from college, whereas in the bottom fifth, just 12 percent hold a college degree (Brooks and Weidrich, 2012). Educational attainment seems to be the key variable for upward mobility in the United States (Urahn et al., 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because you are a college student, chances are that one or both of your parents are college educated and that you grew up enjoying a middle-class lifestyle. If this was the case, what are the chances that you will wind up better off than your parents? A new study of intergenerational income mobility by Stanford researchers found that young people entering the workforce today are considerably less likely to outearn their parents than young people born two generations before them. While 90 percent of young people born in the 1940s went on to earn more than their parents, the same is true of just 50 percent of young people born in the 1980s. In other words, as one of the study’s authors explained, “It’s basically a coin flip as to whether you’ll do better than your parents” (Wong, 2016; Chetty et al., 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In addition, as a result of global economic competition, not nearly enough well-paid positions are open for all who wish to enter them. Even if a higher proportion of jobs is created at managerial and professional levels, the overall number of jobs available in the future may not keep pace with the number of people with college degrees seeking work. Reasons for this gap include the growing number of women entering the workforce and the increasing use of information technology in production processes. Because computerized machinery can now handle tasks—even highly complicated ones—that only humans could do before, many jobs may be eliminated.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Moreover, China, India, Brazil, and other countries are now part of a global workforce in which U.S. workers must compete for jobs. While this has been the case for <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_281" title="281"></span>some time with regard to manufacturing jobs—from automobiles to apparel to electronics—it is increasingly true for higher-skilled, higher-wage jobs as well. As we shall see in <a href="part0090_split_000.html#2LQIK0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 14</a>, many so-called “emerging economies” are now educating a growing number of scientists, engineers, and professionals who will be competing for jobs with U.S. college graduates. Although we are increasingly moving toward an interdependent, global economy, how these shifts will affect your jobs and careers—and stratification in the United States—is difficult to foresee.</p>
