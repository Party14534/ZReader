<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the most disturbing trends documented by gender scholars is the high rate of violence, including sexual violence, against women. From sexual assault on college campuses to the systematic use of rape during wartime, sexual violence remains a pressing concern for scholars and policy makers alike. Why does such violence persist?</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Sexual Violence: Concepts and Patterns</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Before discussing the reasons why gender-based violence persists, it is important that we first review data describing the magnitude and pervasiveness of such violence. Violence directed against women is found in many societies and takes multiple forms, including physical and sexual abuse, mutilation, and murder. A 2013 study by the World Health Organization indicated that more than a third of all women around the world have been abused in some way by intimate partners and that abuse from intimate partners is the most prevalent type of violence against women (World Health Organization, 2013).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-rape" href="part0069_split_004.html#rape">Rape</a> is an all-too-common subtype of violence against women and refers to the forcing of nonconsensual vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse. One in five women worldwide will be a victim of rape or attempted rape in her lifetime; this rate is the same for women in the United States (CDC, 2010). The vast majority of rapes are committed by men against women, although mounting evidence suggests that men also are victims of sexual assault, and gay and transgender men are particularly vulnerable. Early research documented cases where women take sexual advantage of young men who may be insecure, intoxicated, or of a lower status (Anderson and Struckman-Johnson, 1998). More recent data from the Centers for Disease Control (2005) found that 16 percent of men have experienced sexual assault by age 18, often at the hands <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_368" title="368"></span>of a relative or acquaintance. Although all sexual assault is taboo, young men are particularly reluctant to come forward and report their experiences. Many feel stifled because they have internalized the belief that men should be strong, stoic, and able to defend themselves, while those assaulted by other men fear the stigma associated with sex between two men (Kassie, 2015).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Rape is an act of violence committed to wield power and control over its victim. Sexual assault often is carefully planned, rather than performed on the spur of the moment to satisfy some uncontrollable sexual desire. Many rapes involve beatings, knifings, and even murder. In some instances, sexual assault is facilitated by alcohol or women having their drinks spiked with the sedative Rohypnol (i.e., a “roofie”) or drugs referred to as “date-rape drugs” (Michigan Department of Community Health, 2010). Even when rape leaves no physical wounds, it is a highly traumatic violation of the victim’s person that leaves long-lasting psychological scars. This devastation was recounted in vivid and heart-breaking terms by a young woman who was sexually assaulted while unconscious by a Stanford University student-athlete. At the assailant’s sentencing, the woman read a letter in which she shared, “I can’t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up. I did this thing where I waited until the sun came up and I felt safe enough to sleep. . . . It is embarrassing how feeble I feel, how timidly I move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is difficult to know how many rapes actually occur because many rapes go unreported. In one comprehensive study of American sexual behavior, 22 percent of the women surveyed reported having been forced into a sexual encounter. Yet the same study found that only 3 percent of the men admitted to having forced a woman into sex, a discrepancy that the study’s authors attribute to different perceptions between men and women regarding what constitutes forced sex (Laumann et al., 1994). The U.S. Department of Justice estimated that over the past 18 years, nearly 100,000 women between the ages of 18 and 24 were victims of sexual assault every year (U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although media reports sensationalize “stranger rapes,” most rapes are committed by relatives (fathers or stepfathers, brothers, uncles), partners, or acquaintances. Among college students, most rapes are committed by boyfriends, former boyfriends, or classmates (U.S. Department of Justice, 2017). The National Institute of Campus Sexual Assault study presents a chilling picture of violence against women on campuses across the country (Krebs et al., 2007). The study, conducted during the winter of 2006, asked college women about their experience with rape, attempted rape, coerced sex, and unwanted sexual contact. More than 3 percent (3.4 percent) of female students surveyed reported having been raped since entering college. A previous study conducted by the same organization found that for both completed and attempted rapes, 9 out of 10 offenders were known to the victim.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The incidence of other forms of victimization reported in the study was substantially higher than that of rape. Overall, 29 percent of female students reported having experienced attempted or completed sexual assault (Krebs et al., 2007). Moreover, nearly 16 percent of the women reported being victimized by attempted or completed sexual assault before they entered college (19 percent since the beginning of their college career).</p>

<section id="why-does-violence-persist-competing-perspectives">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Why Does Violence Persist? Competing Perspectives</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some radical feminist scholars claim that men are socialized to regard women as sex objects and that this partly explains the high levels of victimization of women (Dworkin, 1987; Griffin, 1979). Susan Brownmiller (1975), for example, claims that the constant threat of rape contributes to a “rape culture” in which male domination fosters a state of continual fear in women. One aspect of a rape culture is male socialization to a sense of sexual entitlement, which may encourage sexual conquest and promote insensitivity to the difference between consensual and nonconsensual sex (Scully, 1990). From seemingly innocent high school locker room jokes, to television commercials and magazine ads depicting women as sexually inviting, to television and movie images equating masculinity with the conquest of women, many men learn to believe that women exist for their pleasure. Under such circumstances, rape is all too “normal” (Wolf, 1992).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Moreover, female victims of sexual assault often are victimized again by judges, community members, and a mass media that subtly or overtly holds women “responsible” for their sexual victimization. In her victim impact letter, the woman at the center of what came to be called the “Stanford rape case” recounted, “I was pummeled with narrowed, pointed questions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family life, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who had me half naked before even bothering to ask for my name.”</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_370" title="370"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The fact that “acquaintance rapes” occur suggests that some men feel entitled to sexual access if they already know the woman. In a survey of nearly 270,000 first-year college students, 55 percent of male students agreed with the following statement: “If two people really like each other, it’s all right for them to have sex even if they’ve known each other only for a very short time.” Only 31 percent of female students agreed (American Council on Education [ACE], 2001). Another national survey reported that 43 percent of all men believed that a woman is partly to blame if she is raped after changing her mind about having sex (Yankelovich, 1991).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because some men are socialized to feel sexual entitlement, rape is most common when men believe that norms condemning rape do not apply—for example, in times of war. Indeed, war-related rapes are as old as human history. Followers of Rome’s legendary founder, Romulus, were reputed to have captured and raped Sabine women to populate Rome. Japanese soldiers raped as many as 20,000 women when they conquered the city of Nanking in China in 1937 (Chang and Kirby, 1997). American soldiers committed rapes during the U.S. Civil War and the Vietnam War.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Rape is an especially potent instrument of war, since it dehumanizes the victims and—where sexual mores are highly restrictive—can break apart families and weaken the resolve of victims to resist their aggressors. David Rosen, professor of sociology and anthropology who has long studied war crimes in Africa, argues that the systematic rape of women by armed militias in Darfur is intended to destroy their communities and ultimately serve as a means of ethnic cleansing (Rosen, 2008). A study of rape in ethno-national conflicts supports this conclusion; it reports that rape is far more likely when the future existence of the state is threatened (Hayden, 2000).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">During World War II, for example, Japanese soldiers forced as many as 200,000 young women and girls to serve as “comfort women” for Japanese troops. These women—mainly Korean but also taken from other Asian countries conquered by the Japanese—were forced to work as sex slaves in military brothels throughout the Pacific. Many died in captivity; others committed suicide (Stetz and Oh, 2001). Rape was widely used as a Serbian strategy in the wars in Kosovo and Bosnia in the 1990s. By systematically raping and impregnating Muslim women, the Serbian forces hoped to humiliate the Muslim population into fleeing their homelands (Allen, 1996). Similarly, rape is used as a weapon of war in the Congo, where groups of armed rebels rape women and children to humiliate them and their families—a context that journalist Nicholas Kristof (2010) has called “the world capital of rape, torture, and mutilation.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sexual assault is devastating to its victims, yet the consequences are particularly dire for those living in cultures that devalue women and women’s sexuality. For example, in their book <i class="italic">Half the Sky</i>, journalists Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn (2009) recount the harrowing experience of Hawa, a young student living in a refugee camp in Sudan’s Darfur region. Hawa was attacked and gang-raped by members of the government-sponsored Janjaweed militia. When her friends attempted to get her medical treatment for her injuries in a small clinic staffed by foreign doctors, local police arrested her. Premarital sexual intercourse is a crime in Sudan. For the police, the act of seeking medical attention constituted proof of Hawa’s sexual engagement, and without the required four male witnesses to testify to the rape, she was presumed to be guilty.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_371" title="371"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sexual violence and partner violence remain critical global health issues. However, policy makers are making incremental strides in both drawing attention to and devising policies to fight such violence. In March 2013, former president Barack Obama reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). VAWA creates and expands federal programs to assist local communities with law enforcement and helps victims of domestic/partner and sexual abuse. Important revisions to the reauthorized act include expanded protection of gay men, lesbian women, transgender individuals, Native Americans, and immigrants—all groups particularly vulnerable to victimization (Parker, 2013). This reauthorized act underscores the importance of recognizing intersectionality in public policies as well as in scholarship, where the intersections of race, class, sexual orientation, and immigrant status may render a person more or less vulnerable to gender-based mistreatment.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">At a global level, the United Nations has been instrumental in raising awareness of sexual violence. In July 2012, the secretary-general’s UNiTE to End Violence against Women campaign rolled out a series of public awareness and education events, which relied on artists and social media to help ensure that schools, workplaces, and cyberspace are safe spaces for women and girls. On the twenty-fifth day of each month, awareness campaigns, public service announcements, and public art exhibits draw attention to violence against women.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Feminist scholars are pessimistic that gendered inequalities, whether pay inequalities or sexual violence, will be eradicated anytime soon. However, Kristof and WuDunn (2009) provide insights into ways that these problems might be attacked, slowly and gradually. They describe the eradication of gendered inequalities as “the paramount moral challenge” of this century, and they believe that the education and financial empowerment of women is a first essential step. A similar recommendation is offered by the United Nations. On July 2, 2010, in a historic moment, the UN General Assembly voted unanimously to establish the UN Entity for Gender Equality and Empowerment, to be known as UN Women. With the establishment of UN Women, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, “UN Women is recognition of a simple truth: Equality for women and girls is not only a basic human right, it is a social and economic imperative. Where women are educated and empowered, economies are more productive and strong. Where women are fully represented, societies are more peaceful and stable” (Fifth World Conference on Women, 2010).</p>
