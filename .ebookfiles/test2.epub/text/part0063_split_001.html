<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">What Are the Causes of Inequality in the World Today?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists Roberto Patricio Korzeniewicz and Timothy Patrick Moran, in their book <i class="italic">Unveiling Inequality</i> (2012), provide a new and imaginative approach to answer an old question: What are the underlying causes of persistent inequality in the world <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_313" title="313"></span>today? Drawing on a world-systems approach, they analyze inequality between and within countries. By using statistical techniques for estimating inequality—including the Gini index, which measures the extent to which the distribution of income deviates from a perfectly equal distribution—they examine both forms of inequality over the past two centuries.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">With regard to inequality within countries, Korzeniewicz and Moran show that many countries are trapped for decades (some for centuries) in a vicious cycle of persistently high levels of inequality, while others enjoy a virtuous cycle resulting in long-term low levels of inequality. One reason some countries are trapped in a cycle of long-term inequality is the central role played by discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, and nationality, which systematically excludes people from economic, social, and political opportunity. Slavery and the legacies of colonialism are key examples.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">With regard to inequality between countries, they find that inequality has increased since the nineteenth century, which suggests that the global system itself is trapped in a vicious cycle of self-perpetuating inequality. Even though some countries move up—Japan, the emerging economies of East Asia, China, India—high levels of inequality persist. Although they do acknowledge that global inequality has actually declined somewhat during the past decade or so, they attribute this drop primarily to the economic rise of China.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A main reason for the persistence of inequality between countries, Korzeniewicz and Moran argue, is that the high-income countries in the world economy have been very effective in developing institutions that assure they remain on top. One such institution is restricting the ability of people from low-income countries to immigrate. While capital can move freely across borders, people cannot. The result is that poor people are largely trapped in poor countries, reinforcing the cycle of poverty in those countries. They conclude that a more open global migration system would help reduce inequality between countries.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While <i class="italic">Unveiling Inequality</i> provides an important explanation for the persistence of long-term inequalities both within and between countries, it arguably overstates the inevitability of long-term inequality in the global system. As global corporations move into lower-income countries in search of low-cost production, they provide jobs for millions of people. As we have seen, these jobs are often under terrible conditions. Yet, in some cases, they have lifted many people into middle-class status. In East Asia and China, this has enabled entire economies to move up in the global stratification system.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The question remains: Whatever the lessons of the past, will the forces reshaping the world economy today increase inequality within and between countries—or do they represent a new dynamic that, in the long run, will result in some form of global economic convergence?</p>
