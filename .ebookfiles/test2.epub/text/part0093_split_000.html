<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The changes we have just described affect many aspects of work and economic life. These changes have generally favored the growing power of corporations relative to their workers. We first look at the growth of transnational corporations and how this is reshaping the nature of economic organization in the twenty-first century, before turning to a discussion of workers, unions, and the challenges they face. We conclude the discussion of current research by looking at some forms of industrial conflict that occur when labor and management fail to agree.</p>
