<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">The Hyperglobalizers</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The hyperglobalizers argue that globalization is a very real phenomenon, the consequences of which can be felt almost everywhere. They see globalization as a process that is indifferent to national borders. In their view, globalization is producing a new global order, swept along by powerful flows of cross-border trade and production. They argue that individual countries no longer control their economies because of the vast growth in world trade. National governments and the politicians within them have decreasing control over the issues that cross their borders, such as volatile financial markets and environmental threats. Citizens recognize that politicians’ ability to address these problems is limited and, as a result, lose faith in existing systems of governance. Some hyperglobalizers believe that the power of national governments is also being challenged from above—by new regional and international institutions, such as the EU and the WTO. These shifts signal the dawning of a global age (Albrow, 1997) in which national governments decline in importance and influence.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists such as William Robinson (2001, 2004), Leslie Sklair (2002a, 2002b, 2003), and Saskia Sassen (1996, 2005) tend to reject the label of <i class="italic">hyperglobalist</i>, a term they associate with such popular writers or journalists as Thomas Friedman, whose best-selling books <i class="italic">The Lexus and the Olive Tree</i> (2000) and <i class="italic">The World Is Flat</i> (2005) paint a picture of globalization as a juggernaut that sweeps up everything in its path. Nonetheless, they do argue that transnational economic actors and political institutions are challenging the dominance of national ones. Robinson has studied these changes throughout the world, with a special focus on Latin America. He argues that the most powerful economic actors today are not bound by national boundaries; they are transnational. For example, the “transnational capitalist class” is emerging out of (and is transforming) the capitalist classes of individual countries, because the transnational corporations they manage are global rather than national. By the same token, he argues that nation-states are becoming “component elements” of a transnational state—exemplified, for example, by the WTO, which serves the interests of global businesses as a whole by ensuring that individual countries adhere to the principles of free trade. Robinson (2001) concludes that “the nation-state is a historically specific form of world social organization in the process of becoming transcended by globalization.”</p>
