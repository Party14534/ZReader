<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In recent years, globalization has become a hotly debated topic. Most people accept that important transformations are occurring, but the extent to which one can attribute them to “globalization” is contested. This disagreement is not surprising, given the unpredictable and turbulent process that globalization involves. David Held and his colleagues (1999) have identified three schools of thought: skeptics, hyperglobalizers, and transformationalists. These approaches to the globalization debate are summarized in Table 20.1.</p>
