<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_5">The Nation-State, National Identity, and Globalization</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In some parts of Africa, nations and nation-states are not yet fully formed. Yet in other areas of the world, some writers are speaking of the “end of the nation-state” in the face of globalization. According to Japanese writer Kenichi Ohmae (1995), we live in a borderless world in which national identity is weakening.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">How valid is this point of view? All states are certainly affected by globalizing processes. The very rise of “nations without states” is probably bound up with globalization. As globalization progresses, people often revive local identities to achieve security in the rapidly changing world. Nations have less economic power of their own than they used to have, as a result of the spreading global marketplace.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet it wouldn’t be accurate to say that we are witnessing the end of the nation-state. In some ways, the opposite is the case. Today, the nation-state has become a universal political form. Until quite recently, it still had rivals; after all, for most of the twentieth century, colonized areas and empires existed alongside nation-states. It is arguable that the last empire disappeared only in 1990, with the collapse of Soviet communism (see <a href="part0053_split_000.html#1IHDQ0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 8</a>). The satellite states constituting the Soviet Union’s former empire in Eastern Europe now have become independent nation-states, as have many areas inside the former Soviet Union itself. There are far more sovereign nations today than there were 25 years ago.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A more accurate way of framing the current situation would be to think of two powerful forces at play today—the international world of nation-states and the transnational forces of globalization that are challenging the nation-state. Nation-states remain important in the world today; they alone have governments and legal structures, along with the means to enforce laws—both internally (through police powers) and externally (through military means). Nation-states are the recognized actors in international organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization; they form economic and military alliances with one another, and all too often wage wars to achieve their objectives.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet the economic, political, environmental, and cultural power of nation-states is everywhere being challenged by globalizing forces that show little regard for national borders. Trillions of dollars cross borders with the click of a mouse, while products that are designed in one country give jobs to workers half a world away. As we discuss in the next section, military force seems to be of limited value against stateless enemies such as al Qaeda and ISIS, which operate in many countries yet pledge allegiance to none. Global warming and environmental degradation threaten everyone on <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_495" title="495"></span>the planet, regardless of which country is the immediate source of the problem. YouTube, the Internet, and popular culture generally flow freely around the world, despite the efforts of authoritarian regimes to control them.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Whether the outcome of this titanic conflict between nation-states and globalization will ultimately favor one or the other is uncertain—which is one reason globalization has become such a fascinating topic for sociologists and other social scientists to study.</p>
