<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A second influential perspective is credentialism. Adherents to this way of thinking place less emphasis on the content of an official curriculum. They argue that the specific skills and information that students learn in the classroom are much less relevant to their later achievements than the actual diploma. The primary social function of mass education derives from the need for degrees to determine oneâ€™s credentials for a job, even if the work involved has nothing to do with the education one has <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_619" title="619"></span>received (Collins, 1979). Over time, the practice of credentialism results in demands for higher credentials, which require higher levels of educational attainment. Jobs that 30 years ago would have required a high school diploma, such as that of a sales representative, now require a college degree. Since educational attainment is closely related to class position, credentialism reinforces the class structure within a society.</p>
