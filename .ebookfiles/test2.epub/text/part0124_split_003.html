<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most urban growth is now occurring in cities in the global south, in regions with large populations. Africa remains mostly rural, with 57 percent of its 1.3 billion people still living in rural areas—a figure that rises to 72 percent in eastern Africa. Parts of Asia also remain highly rural: Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of South Asia’s 1.9 billion people still live outside of urban areas (a region that includes India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan) (UN DESA, 2018c). By mid-century, this is predicted to change dramatically. By 2050, 59 percent of all Africans and 54 percent of southern Asians will be living in urban areas—a rural-urban shift involving some 1.5 billion people in these two regions alone. For the less developed regions of the world as a whole (excluding China), the rural-urban shift is predicted to involve more than 2 billion people. These shifts are likely due to two factors: The previously noted higher birthrates in poor countries, in urban as well as rural areas, and widespread <i class="italic">internal migration</i> from rural areas to urban ones, as rural poverty prompts many people to try their hand at city life: According to the World Bank (2017b), urban areas account for roughly four-fifths of the world’s gross domestic product. China is a case in point: Over the past three decades, as China transitioned from a largely impoverished country to the world’s second largest economy, it also transitioned from being 26 percent to 61 percent urban. In what is likely the largest internal migration in history, hundreds of millions of Chinese moved from farms and villages to giant cities, where jobs in factories and supporting services could be found (UNDESA, 2018b, 2018c).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Rapid urbanization in the global south may provide the promise of work and a better life for many, but it has brought many problems as well. Factory jobs turn out to require endless hours, provide low pay, are completely lacking in basic workers’ rights, and involve extremely hazardous working conditions. To take one example, over the past couple decades more than 2,000 factory workers have perished in fires and building collapses in Bangladesh, a country that has emerged as a major source of garment manufacturing (Appelbaum and Lichtenstein, 2016). Because the migration to cities often exceeds the available jobs, an informal economy emerges consisting of unregulated work done for cash “off the books” that is barely a step above poverty (<a href="part0090_split_000.html#2LQIK0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 14</a>). In India, for example, the informal economy accounts for 84 percent of nonagricultural employment (ILO, 2013). While such work may be important for helping thousands of families (and women especially) to survive in urban conditions, it is often harsh and exploitative. And since it is off the books, it is also untaxed, denying the state badly needed revenues.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another problem of rapid urbanization in the global south is housing: As many as a billion people are now forced to live in makeshift shantytowns and squatter settlements on the fringes of megacities, resulting in what urban historian Mike Davis (2007) has graphically described as a “planet of slums.” Brazil’s two largest cities, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, house millions of people in makeshift hillside shantytowns called <i class="italic">favelas</i>; it is estimated that in Rio alone, nearly a quarter of the city’s 6 million residents live in roughly a thousand such communities. While some <i class="italic">favelas</i> are notorious for being dangerous, crime-ridden places that lack adequate water, sanitation, and basic urban services, many serve as functioning communities for the city’s urban poor, the only housing that they can afford (Catalytic Communities, 2015). Living in even crime-ridden shantytowns is preferable to the only alternative that many urban poor face: living on the streets.</p>
