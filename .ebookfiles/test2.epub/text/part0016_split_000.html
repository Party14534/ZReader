<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Regardless of whether it is quantitative or qualitative, sociological research that is striving to be scientific tries to meet basic scientific standards (King, Keohane, and Verba, 1994).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">First, the goal of sociological research is <i class="italic">inference</i>. By this we mean that when we make observations particular to a specific setting or group, the goal is to be able to generalize beyond that specific entity to others of its kind. In other words, while sociologists cannot collect data about the whole world, they are able to use more limited data to make broader claims about phenomena they cannot directly observe (King et al., 1994). Take as an example <i class="italic">Uncoupling</i>. If Diane Vaughan limited her claim to the 103 interviews she recorded, this material on its own would not constitute a sociological analysis. Moving beyond these interviews to make more general claims about how we—as humans—form and break romantic relationships is part of what makes her analysis scientific.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Second, sociologists must ensure that other researchers can retrace the paths to their findings. Ideally, others in the scientific community can reproduce their results. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_34" title="34"></span>The procedures researchers use for collecting and analyzing data should be public; the reliability of research data can only be verified if the ways in which that data were collected and processed are made explicit to the scientific community, allowing other researchers both to learn from the methods used and to address the limitations of these methods. What’s more, careful documentation of the way one arrives at conclusions about the social world allows research findings to be comparable even when conducted by researchers at different times.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Third, the conclusions of all scientific research, including sociology, are uncertain. This might be surprising. Isn’t the purpose of studying the social world to be able to make forceful arguments about it? The values of science sometimes demand that we do the opposite. The scientific validity of inferences can be assessed only if researchers are clear about all the sources of their uncertainty. In sociology, like any science, the highest status is conferred on those who are honest about how certain their conclusions really are. Sociologists need to specify all the possible sources of uncertainty in their study.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">All three of the previous standards of empirical research are found in both the natural sciences and the social sciences. They are also shared by quantitative and qualitative social science. It is important to highlight a fourth element that is emphasized more in the social sciences—particularly in qualitative research. This is called <i class="italic">reflexivity</i>. For social scientists, it is particularly important to acknowledge that the investigator is a crucial part of the world she studies and cannot necessarily divorce herself from it. This includes power dynamics among subjects and the ways in which personal values or personal identity influence both the nature of the questions asked and the interpretation of data. Social scientists must thus be ready to reflect on how the way they are part of the social scenes they study may affect the kinds of conclusions they draw. For example, a middle-class researcher studying a poor population should be clear about how his or her class position influenced a sociological argument or the relations with subjects.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These four principles help identify work that is living up to the highest ideals of social science. Some good scientific work might not necessarily be strong in all the areas at once, but the goal of social science should be to achieve as many of them as possible. While these principles are useful for understanding how sociology can strive to be a science, they don’t provide a practical guide for how one might begin defining and going on to answer a research question. To do this, we now consider the research process.</p>
