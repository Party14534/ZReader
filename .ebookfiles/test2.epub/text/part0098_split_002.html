<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Historical Perspectives on Families</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Historical lore and nostalgia tend to romanticize the ways families were in the past, erroneously characterizing highly interdependent extended families as the norm. However, the notion that the extended family was the predominant form of family in premodern eras has been disproved. Historical research shows that the nuclear family has long been preeminent. Throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries in the United States, the average household size was just 4.75 persons, often including domestic servants. The current average is 2.5, which isn’t dramatically lower than the average household size several centuries ago (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2017c). The smaller size today is largely due to the high proportion of Americans who live alone, especially older widowed women and young professionals who maintain their own homes (Klinenberg, 2012a).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Other historical research also challenges the idyllic image some hold of families in the days of yore. In the premodern United States and Europe, children as young as seven or eight often worked, helping their parents on the farm. Most who did not remain in the family enterprise left the parental household at an early age to do domestic work for others or to follow apprenticeships. Children who went away to work rarely saw their parents again. Families also were unstable and impermanent then, as they are today (a theme we revisit later in this chapter). High mortality rates (numbers of deaths per 1,000 of the population in any one year) meant that a quarter or more of all infants in early modern Europe died within the first year of life, and women frequently died in childbirth. The notion of staying married until “old age” often was not realized due to mortality. The death of children or of one or both spouses often shattered family relations. Instability and severed ties are permanent functions of family life throughout history, although the reasons may differ.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The emotional and interpersonal nature of families also has shifted over time. Historical sociologist Lawrence Stone (1980) distinguished three phases in the development of the family from the 1500s to the 1800s. First, from the fifteenth century to the early seventeenth century, the main form was a type of nuclear family that lived in fairly small households but maintained deeply embedded relationships within the community, including with other kin. According to Stone (although some historians have challenged this idea), the family was <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_575" title="575"></span>not a major focus of emotional attachment or dependence for its members, as it is today. Individual freedom of choice in courtship, marriage, and other matters of family life were subordinated to the interests of parents, other kin, or the community. Sex within marriage was not regarded as a source of pleasure but as a necessity to produce children. Outside of aristocratic circles, where it was sometimes actively encouraged, passionate or romantic love was regarded by moralists and theologians as a sickness. As Stone (1980) put it, the family during this period “was an open-ended, low-keyed, unemotional, authoritarian institution. . . . It was also very short-lived, being frequently dissolved by the death of the husband or wife or the death or very early departure from the home of the children.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Next came a transitional form of family that lasted from the early seventeenth century to the beginning of the eighteenth. Although largely a feature of the upper classes of society, this form was very important because from it spread attitudes that have since become almost universal. The nuclear family became a more separate entity, distinct from other kin and the local community. There was a growing emphasis on marital and parental love, although the authoritarian power of fathers also increased.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The third phase, which emerged in the mid-eighteenth century and persisted through the mid-twentieth century, gave rise to the type of family system currently widespread in the West. This family is a group tied by close emotional bonds, domestic privacy, and child-rearing. It is marked by <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-affective-individualism" href="part0098_split_003.html#affective-individualism">affective individualism</a>, courtship and marriage based on personal choice, and sexual attraction or romantic love. Sexual aspects of love became glorified within marriage instead of in extramarital relationships. The family became geared to consumption rather than production, as a result of workplaces being separate from the home. Women became associated with domesticity and men with being the breadwinners. Originating among affluent groups, this family type became fairly universal in Western countries with the spread of industrialization.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In premodern Europe, marriage usually began as a property arrangement. In the middle years of marriage, the couple focused mainly on raising children, whereas in the later stages, marriage was about love. Few couples married for love, but many grew to love each other as they jointly managed their household, raised their children, and shared a lifetime of experiences together. By contrast, in most of the modern West, marriage begins with a couple in love; in its middle, it is mostly about raising children (if there are children), and marital quality wanes. By later life, those couples whose marriages survive are typically marked by high levels of love, affection, and companionship (Karney and Bradbury, 1995; Umberson et al., 2005).</p>
