<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">The Second Generation of Theories: Social Conflict</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Unlike their predecessors, who emphasized the ways older adults could be integrated into society, the second generation of theorists focused on sources of social conflict between retirement-age persons and the larger society (Hendricks, 1992). Like other theorists who were studying social conflict in U.S. society during the 1970s and early 1980s, these theorists stressed the ways in which the larger social structure helped shape the opportunities available to older adults; unequal opportunities were seen as creating the potential for conflict.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to this view, many of the problems of aging—such as poverty, poor health, or inadequate health care—are systematically produced by the routine operation of social institutions. A capitalist society, the reasoning goes, favors those who are most economically powerful. While some older people certainly have “made it” and are set <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_429" title="429"></span>for life, many have not—and these people must fight to get even a meager share of society’s scarce resources.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-conflict-theories-of-aging" href="part0079_split_004.html#conflict-theories-of-aging">Conflict theories of aging</a> flourished during the 1980s, when a shrinking job base and cutbacks in federal spending threatened to pit different social groups against each other in the competition for scarce resources. Older persons were seen as competing with the young for increasingly scarce jobs and dwindling federal dollars. Conflict theorists further pointed out that even among older adults, those who fared worst were women, low-income people, and ethnic minorities (Atchley, 2000; Estes, 2011; Hendricks, 1992; Hendricks and Hendricks, 1986).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we will see later in this chapter, the concerns articulated by conflict theorists persist today. For example, while poverty rates among older adults have plummeted over the past 60 years, with less than 10 percent of older adults now living in poverty, this figure is as high as 40 percent among unmarried Black and Hispanic older women (Carr, 2019).</p>
