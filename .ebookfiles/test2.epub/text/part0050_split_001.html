<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Why Have Crime Rates Gone Down?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Beginning in the 1990s, crime rates began to decline nationwide. In 2011, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that crime rates reached a 40-year low—even in the aftermath of the recession of 2008, bucking the conventional wisdom that poor economic conditions lead to elevated crime rates. Incredibly, rates of murder, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery, dropped considerably—though some cities (such as New York) experienced some increases in numbers of violent crime. That said, these increases pale in comparison to comparable figures in the 1990s (Oppel, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Criminologists nationwide have offered a number of different explanations for this decline. Some have suggested that better economic conditions and lower unemployment lead to decreased crime rates, though lower crime rates following the 2008 recession present a challenge to this theory. Others argue that citizens have become more adept at protecting themselves against crime through the use of sophisticated home security systems, while policing has become more targeted and disciplined, with police now using “hot-spot policing” to station officers around areas in which they <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_227" title="227"></span>know crime rates are relatively high. Still more scholars have suggested that the drop in crime may be related to decreasing cocaine and other illegal drug usage or even lower levels of lead in Americans’ blood (which has been linked to higher levels of aggression in children) (Wilson, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we have seen earlier in this chapter, one popular hypothesis is that mass incarceration is related to a lower crime rate. Given that the U.S. crime rate decreased over roughly the same period (beginning in the mid-1970s), this correlation might suggest that imprisonment is an effective deterrent for crime. Indeed, Americans today favor tougher prison sentences for all but relatively minor crimes. However, even if the prison system were expanded, it wouldn’t significantly reduce the level of serious crime. Less than half of violent crimes result in arrest, and nearly half of arrests do not result in conviction (FBI, 2014c; FBI, 2014d). Further, America’s prisons are so overcrowded that the average convict released from prison served less than half of their sentence (Kaeble, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">About one-third of African American men are in the U.S. correctional system (NAACP, 2014; Gramlich, 2019b). In some major urban areas, counting those currently in prison, more than half of working-age African American men have criminal records (Alexander, 2011). Given that prisons often make offenders more hardened criminals, it is increasingly unclear whether imprisonment leads to a lower crime rate. The harsher and more oppressive prison conditions are, the more likely it is that inmates will be brutalized by the experience. Yet if prisons were attractive and pleasant places to live, would they have a deterrent effect?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although prisons do keep some dangerous men (and a tiny minority of dangerous women) off the streets, evidence suggests a need for other means to deter crime. Robert Gangi, director of the Correctional Association of New York, said that “building more prisons to address crime is like building more graveyards to address a fatal disease” (quoted in Smolowe, 1994).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">All in all, a sociological interpretation of crime makes clear that there are no quick fixes. The causes of crime, especially crimes of violence, are bound up with structural conditions of American society, including widespread poverty, the condition of the inner cities, and the deteriorating life circumstances of many young men.</p>
