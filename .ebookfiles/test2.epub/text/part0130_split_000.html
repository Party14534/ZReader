<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we have emphasized throughout this textbook, <i class="italic">globalization</i> refers to the fact that we increasingly live in one world, so that individuals, groups, and nations become more <i class="italic">interdependent</i>—that is, what happens 12,000 miles away is likely to have enormous consequence for our daily lives. In this section, we examine how advances in technology, coupled with political and economic changes, including the rise of transnational corporations, have contributed to globalization. We then consider the impact of globalization on both our personal lives and the wider social world, examining how globalization has introduced new forms of risk and exacerbated global wealth inequality.</p>
