<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One influential recent approach to the sociology of religion is tailored to societies, such as the United States, that encompass many different faiths. Taking their cue from <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_665" title="665"></span>economic theory, sociologists who favor the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-religious-economy" href="part0110_split_004.html#religious-economy">religious economy</a> approach argue that religions can be understood as organizations in competition with one another for followers (Finke and Stark, 1988, 2005; Hammond, 1992; Moore, 1994; Roof and McKinney, 1990; Stark and Bainbridge, 1980, 1985, 1987; Warner, 1993). These sociologists argue that competition is preferable to monopoly when it comes to ensuring religious vitality. Whereas the classical theorists Marx, Durkheim, and Weber assumed that religion was weakened when challenged by different religious or secular viewpoints, the advocates of the religious economy perspective argue that competition increases the overall level of religious involvement in society. First, the competition makes each religious group try that much harder to win followers. Second, the presence of numerous religions means there is likely something for everyone. In a culturally diverse society, a single religion will probably appeal to a limited range of followers, whereas the presence of, say, Hindu gurus and fundamentalist preachers, in addition to mainline churches, will likely encourage a high level of religious participation.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">Religious economy scholars argue that successful religious groups must have effective representatives spreading their beliefs. For example, the fall of communism in Mongolia brought religious freedom to this sparsely populated country located between China and Russia. It also brought foreigners eager for converts, such as Mormon missionaries.</figcaption>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This analysis is adapted from the business world, in which competition presumably encourages the emergence of specialized products appealing to specific markets. In fact, religious economists borrow the language of business in describing the conditions that lead to the success or failure of a particular religious organization. According to Finke and Stark (2005), a successful religious group must be well organized for competition, have eloquent preachers who are effective “sales reps” in spreading the word, offer beliefs and rituals that are packaged as an appealing product, and develop effective marketing techniques. Television evangelists, or televangelists, have been especially good businesspeople in selling religious products. As Finke and Stark (2005) put it, “The churching of America was accomplished by aggressive churches committed to vivid otherworldliness.” Religious economy scholars thus do not see competition as undermining religious beliefs and contributing to secularization. Rather, they argue that modern religion constantly renews itself through active marketing and recruitment.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_666" title="666"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although a large body of research supports the notion that competition is good for religion, not all studies come to this same conclusion (Land, Deane, and Blau, 1991). Some have argued that the religious economy approach overestimates the extent to which people rationally choose a religion. According to this view, among deeply committed believers, even in societies where people can choose among religions, most practice their childhood religion without considering alternatives. Wade Clark Roof’s 1993 study of 1,400 baby boomers found that a third remained loyal to their childhood faith, while another third continued to profess their childhood beliefs although they no longer belonged to a religious organization. Thus, only a third were actively seeking a new religion, making the sorts of choices the religious economy approach presumes.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A study by the Pew Research Center, however, found Americans to be more religiously fickle than was previously believed. The study, based on thousands of interviews, concluded, “Americans change religious affiliation early and often” (Pew Research Center, 2009). A more recent 2015 study from Pew found that a third of American adults (34 percent) practice a different religion than the one they were born into, not including switching among different Protestant denominations (Pew Research Center, 2015c). Americans—especially young people—more than ever seem to be a nation of seekers.</p>
