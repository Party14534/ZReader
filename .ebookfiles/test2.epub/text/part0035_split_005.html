<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_5">Response Cries</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Certain kinds of utterances are not talk but consist of muttered exclamations, or what Goffman (1981) has called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-response-cries" href="part0035_split_008.html#response-cries">response cries</a>. Consider Lucy, who exclaims, “Oops!” after knocking over a glass of water. “Oops!” seems to be merely an uninteresting reflex response to a mishap, rather like blinking your eye when a person moves a hand sharply toward your face. It is not a reflex, however, as shown by the fact that people do not usually make the exclamation when alone. “Oops!” is normally directed toward others present. The exclamation demonstrates to witnesses that the lapse is only minor and momentary, not something that should cast doubt on Lucy’s command of her actions.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Phrases like “Oops!” or “My bad!” are used only in situations of minor failure, rather than in major accidents or calamities—which also demonstrates that the exclamation is part of our controlled management of the details of social life. Moreover, these phrases may be used by someone observing Lucy rather than by Lucy herself, or <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_143" title="143"></span>they may be used to sound a warning to another. <i class="italic">Oops</i> is normally a short sound, but the <i class="italic">oo</i> may be prolonged in some situations. Thus, someone might extend the sound to cover a critical moment in performing a task. For instance, a parent may utter an extended “Oops!” or “Oops-a-daisy!” when playfully tossing a child in the air. The sound covers the brief phase when the child may feel a loss of control, reassuring him and probably at the same time developing his understanding of response cries.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This may all sound very contrived and exaggerated. Why bother to analyze such an inconsequential utterance in such detail? Surely we don’t pay as much attention to what we say as this example suggests? Of course we don’t—on a conscious level. The crucial point, however, is that we take for granted the immensely complicated, continuous control of our appearance and actions. In situations of interaction, we are never expected simply to be present. Others expect, as we expect of them, that we will display what Goffman calls “controlled alertness.” A fundamental part of being human is continually demonstrating to others our competence in the routines of daily life.</p>
