<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">High-income countries are generally those that industrialized first, a process that began in England some 250 years ago and then spread to the rest of Europe, the United States, and Canada. In the 1960s, Japan joined their ranks, while Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan did so only within the last several decades (Global Map 9.1). Most high-income countries are found in Europe, North America (United States, Canada), and the East Asian/Pacific region (Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan). There are also a few high-income countries in South America (Chile, Uruguay, Panama) and the Middle East (Israel; and such oil-rich countries as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates), as well as a scattering of islands in the Caribbean (for example, The Bahamas, Puerto Rico). The average annual income for people living in high-income countries was $44,275 in 2018. High-income countries are home to only 16 percent of the world’s population (1.2 billion people), yet they command 63 percent of the world’s total GNI (World Bank, 2019c). Although they often have large numbers of poor people, they also offer decent housing, adequate food, drinkable water, and other comforts—a standard of living unimaginable by the majority of the world’s people.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Like individuals in a country, the countries of the world as a whole can be seen as economically stratified. In general, those countries that experienced industrialization the earliest are the richest, while those that remain agricultural are the poorest. An enormous, and growing, gulf separates the two groups.</p>
