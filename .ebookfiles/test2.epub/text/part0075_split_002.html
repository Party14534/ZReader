<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">On the one hand, an increasing number of Blacks joined the middle class by acquiring college degrees, professional jobs, and new homes. On the other hand, Blacks are far more likely than Whites to live in poverty and be socially isolated from good schools and economic opportunity. Also, many immigrants came to the United States throughout the 1980s and 1990s to find new economic opportunity. Yet some of these groups, particularly Mexicans, have among the lowest levels of educational achievement and live in dire poverty. Most sociologists agree on the facts about racial and ethnic inequality but disagree on how to interpret them. Is racial and ethnic inequality primarily the result of a person’s racial or ethnic background, or does it reflect a person’s class position? In this section, we examine how racial and ethnic inequality is reflected in educational and occupational attainment, income, health, residential segregation, and political power.</p>
<section id="educational-attainment">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Educational Attainment</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Differences between Blacks and Whites in levels of educational attainment have decreased, but these seem more the result of long-established trends than the direct <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_405" title="405"></span>outcome of the struggles of the 1960s. The U.S. high school graduation rate reached an all-time high of 85 percent in 2016–2017. Asian/Pacific Islander students had the highest graduation rate at 91 percent, compared to 89 percent for White students, 80 percent for Hispanic students, and 78 percent for Black students (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2019b). The proportion of Blacks over the age of 25 with high school diplomas increased from about 20 percent in 1960 to 87 percent in 2016. By contrast, 90.1 percent of non-Hispanic Whites have completed high school (Figure 11.2A) (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2020).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While more Blacks are attending college now than in the 1960s, a much higher proportion of Whites than Blacks have bachelor’s degrees (Figure 11.2B). In today’s global economy and job market, which value college degrees, the result is a wide disparity in incomes between Whites and Blacks (see the next section, “Employment and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_406" title="406"></span>Income”). Still, the number of bachelor’s degrees awarded to Blacks each year nearly tripled between 1990 and 2015 (NCES, 2016b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another trend is the large gap in educational attainment between Hispanics and both Whites and Blacks. While the dropout rate for Hispanic students has decreased considerably in recent years, Hispanics still have the highest high school dropout rate of any group in the United States (9.5 percent, compared to 5.7 percent for Blacks and 4.6 percent for Whites) (NCES, 2018b). While rates of college attendance and graduation have improved for other groups, the rate for Hispanics has held relatively steady since the mid-1980s. Only about 18.8 percent hold a bachelor’s degree, compared with 40.2 percent of non-Hispanic Whites (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is possible that these poor results reflect the large number of poorly educated immigrants from Latin America who have come to the United States since the 1980s, many of whom have limited English-language skills and whose children encounter difficulties in school. One study found, however, that even among Mexican Americans whose families have lived in the United States for three generations or more, there has been a decline in educational attainment (Bean et al., 1994). For Hispanics with low levels of education and poor language skills, living in the United States has been “the American nightmare, not the American dream” (Holmes, 1997).</p>

<section id="employment-and-income">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Employment and Income</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As a result of increased educational attainment, Blacks now hold slightly more managerial and professional jobs than they did in 1960, though still not in proportion to their overall numbers. In 2019, out of about 59 million managerial or professional positions in the United States, Blacks held 9.6 percent; Hispanics, 9.7 percent; and Asians, 8.5 percent; the other nearly three-quarters were held by Whites (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2019i).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The unemployment rate of Black and Hispanic men outstrips that of Whites by the same degree today as in the early 1960s. While the total unemployment rates for all groups jumped after the economic crisis of 2007, the total unemployment rate for Blacks and Hispanics is higher than that for Whites. The proportion of unemployed Whites increased from 3.5 percent in 2005 to 7.5 percent in 2010, while the proportion of unemployed Blacks increased from 7.5 percent in 2005 to 13.4 percent in 2010, and the proportion of unemployed Hispanics increased from 4.8 percent in 2005 to 10.8 percent in 2010 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2012c). As of 2018, unemployment rates had fallen across the board, but disparities remained: 3.5 percent for Whites, 6.5 percent for Blacks, 4.7 percent for Hispanics, and 3.0 percent for Asians (BLS, 2019i). However, this gap is considerably smaller among more educated persons ages 25 and over. The unemployment rates for adults with a bachelor’s degree or more are 2.0, 2.9, and 2.9 percent for Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics, respectively (BLS, 2019h).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There has also been debate about whether employment opportunities for minorities have improved or worsened, especially in the wake of the recent recession. Statistics on unemployment don’t adequately measure economic opportunity because they reflect only those known to be looking for work. A higher proportion of disillusioned Blacks and Hispanics have simply opted out of the occupational system, neither working nor looking for work. They have become disillusioned by the frustration of searching for <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_407" title="407"></span>employment that is not there. Unemployment figures also do not reflect the increasing numbers of young minority men in prison (see also <a href="part0046_split_000.html#1BRPS0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 7</a>).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While the disparities between the earnings of Blacks and Whites have diminished, significant gaps in earnings and income remain (Figure 11.3). As measured in terms of median weekly earnings, Black men earned 74.9 percent of the level of pay of White men in 2019 (BLS, 2019q). In 1959, the proportion was 49 percent. Black women fare relatively better but still lag behind White women today, earning 81 percent as much as their White counterparts. The Black-White gap in household income has remained relatively unchanged since the early 1970s. In 2018, median household income for Blacks was $40,258, less than 60 percent of median household income for Whites that year ($68,145) (U.S Census Bureau, 2017l). Even more stark in the recent recessionary era is the Black-White gap in wealth: The median household net worth among Whites is 14 times that of Blacks ($132,483 versus $9,211 in 2013) (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2017o).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Though the economic status of Blacks appears to have improved, prospects for Hispanics stagnated or worsened over the same time period. Between 2000 and 2012, Hispanic household incomes (adjusted for inflation) decreased significantly. Yet the rate of Hispanic household poverty has remained very similar to that of Blacks. In 2017, the poverty rate was 18.3 percent for Hispanics and 21.2 percent for Blacks (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018c). The large influx of poor immigrants explains some of the decline in average income, but even among Hispanics born in the United States, income levels have declined. As one Latino group leader commented, “Most Hispanic residents are caught in jobs like gardener, nanny, and restaurant worker that will never pay well and from which they will never advance” (quoted in Goldberg, 1997). As a result, Hispanic households lagged far behind White households. In 2017, median household <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_408" title="408"></span>income of Hispanics was 74 percent that of non-Hispanic Whites (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017l). The median White household wealth was more than 10 times that of Hispanics ($139,300 versus $19,990) (Eggleston &amp; Hays, 2019).</p>

<section id="health">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Health</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Race not only affects our life chances in the form of education, employment, and income; it also has an impact on our health. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic is a perfect case in point. Though the virus was dubbed the great equalizer—one that struck rich and poor alike—the statistics indicate otherwise. The rate of infection, hospitalization, and fatality was, in fact, far higher among Blacks and Latinos than it was among Whites and Asians. Although scientists and the media reported that the greatest risk factor for those infected was age, the number of fatalities among Blacks and Latinos ages 18 to 49 belied that claim. Indeed, by April 2020 it became clear that Blacks were bearing the brunt of the pandemic. Constituting a mere 13 percent of the U.S. population, they accounted for 30 percent of the deaths. In some states the disparity was even worse; in Wisconsin, for example, where Blacks amount to only 6 percent of the population, they accounted for 40 percent of the fatalities. As there is no evidence that people of color are more susceptible to coronavirus, how can this difference be explained?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The answer seems to lie primarily in preexisting medical issues caused by social inequality. Studies by the CDC indicate that Blacks and Latinos have significantly higher rates of obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes—all conditions that exacerbate the effects of the coronavirus and increase the possibility of hospitalization and death. The vulnerability of these populations to these pre-conditions is due to a combination of factors, most notably their lower socioeconomic status within society, their lack of access to decent healthcare coverage, as well as the stresses that arise from working multiple jobs, living in sub-par housing, and dealing with the pressure of constant financial instability. Moreover, due to redlining and housing discrimination, people of color are also more likely to live in neighborhoods close to large highways, toxic waste dumps, and factories, where they are exposed to pollutants that may cause respiratory conditions that likewise increase their risk of suffering the more dangerous symptoms of COVID-19. Finally, their susceptibility to the virus was magnified by the fact that people of color tended to be employed in jobs that could not be moved online during the pandemic. Thus, while more affluent professionals could isolate themselves at home, Blacks and Latinos continued doing essential work such as delivering mail and food, tending to the sick in hospitals, conducting public transportation, and cleaning public and private spaces—thereby increasing their potential exposure to the disease.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In short, the pandemic was less an equalizer than a magnifier of already existent racial inequality that corroborated many previous studies, such as that conducted by Jake Najman (1993), who surveyed the evidence linking health to racial and economic inequalities. Najman also considered strategies for improving the health of the poorer groups in society. After studying data for a number of countries, including the United States, he concluded that for people in the poorest 20 percent, as measured in terms of income, the death rates were 1.5–2.5 times those of the highest 20 percent of income earners. In the United States, the rate of infant mortality for the poorest 20 percent <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_409" title="409"></span>was four times higher than for the wealthiest 20 percent. When differences were measured between the wealthiest Whites and the poorest African Americans in the United States, rather than only in terms of income, the contrast in infant mortality rates was even higher—five times higher for Blacks than for Whites. We have, however, seen some improvement in recent years: Between 1995 and 2017, the infant mortality rate for Blacks dropped from 14.6 to 11 deaths per 1,000 births, narrowing the Black-White gap in infant mortality by 30 percent.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While there remains a Black-White gap in life expectancy—the average age to which an individual at birth can expect to live—this gap has also decreased in recent years, from 7 years in 1990 to 3.5 years in 2017; this decrease is due in part to greater decreases in death rates for Blacks for heart disease, cancer, and HIV (Arias and Xu, 2019). The homicide death rate for Blacks has also gone down, though the peak rate for Black men is still nearly nine times higher than for White men (Smith and Cooper, 2013).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">How might the influence of poverty and race on health be countered? Extensive programs of health education and disease prevention are one possibility. But such programs work better among prosperous, well-educated groups and usually produce only small changes in behavior. Increased accessibility to health services would help, but probably to a limited degree. The only truly effective policy option, it is argued, would be to attack poverty itself, so as to reduce the income gap between rich and poor (Najman, 1993).</p>

<section id="residential-segregation">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_4">Residential Segregation</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Neighborhood segregation seems to have declined little over the past quarter century. Studies show that discriminatory practices between Black and White clients in the housing market continue (Pager and Shepard, 2008). Black and White children now attend the same schools in most rural areas of the South and in many smaller and medium-size cities throughout the country. Most Black college students now also attend the same colleges and universities as Whites, instead of all-Black institutions (Bullock, 1984; U.S. Department of Education, 2016). Yet, in the larger cities, a high level of educational segregation persists as a result of the continuing movement of Whites to suburbs or rural areas. A recent report out of UCLA on educational segregation found that the average Black student attends a school that is 49 percent Black while the average White student attends a school with just 8 percent Black students. In central cities, nearly 90 percent of students are non-White. Importantly, schools that serve majority Black and Latino students are also predominantly low income, amounting to what the study authors refer to as “double segregation”—segregation by both race and class (Orfield and Frankenberg, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In <i class="italic">American Apartheid</i> (1993), Douglas S. Massey and Nancy A. Denton argue that the history of racial segregation and its urban form, the Black ghetto, are responsible for the perpetuation of Black poverty and the continued polarization of Black and White people. Even many middle-class Blacks still find themselves segregated from White society. For them, as for poor Blacks, this becomes a self-perpetuating cycle. Affluent Blacks who could afford to live in predominantly White neighborhoods may choose not to because of the struggle for acceptance they might face. The Black ghetto, the authors conclude, was constructed through a series of well-defined institutional <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_410" title="410"></span>practices of racial discrimination—private behavior and public policies by which Whites sought to contain growing urban Black populations. Until policy makers, social scientists, and private citizens recognize the crucial role of such institutional discrimination in perpetuating urban poverty and racial injustice, the United States will remain a deeply divided and troubled society.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_5">Political Power</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Barack Obama made history when he was elected the first Black president of the United States in 2008. His election is part of a larger trend of Blacks making tremendous gains in holding elective offices; the number of Black public officials increased from 40 in 1960 to 9,101 in 2000 and more than 10,500 in 2010 (Bositis, 2001; Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, 2011). In spite of high-profile victories such as Obama’s, most elected Black officials hold relatively minor local positions, although they do include quite a few mayors and judges.</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The share of representation that Latinos and African Americans have in Congress is still not proportionate to their percentage of the population; however, racial minorities now represent nearly a quarter of Congress. In 2019, there were 52 Black members and 42 Hispanic members of Congress (Brown and Atske, 2019). Most of this diversity is found in the House of Representatives. As of 2019, there were still only three Black senators—Kamala Harris from California, Cory Booker from New Jersey, and Tim <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_411" title="411"></span>Scott from South Carolina—and four Hispanic senators: Catherine Cortez Masto from Nevada, Bob Menendez from New Jersey, Marco Rubio from Florida, and Ted Cruz from Texas.</p>
