<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Can We Reduce Crime through New Policing Techniques?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some sociologists and criminologists have suggested that visible policing techniques, such as patrolling the streets, are reassuring for the public. Such activities support the perception that the police actively control crime, investigate offenses, and support the criminal justice system. But sociologists also see a need to reassess the role of policing in the late modern age. Policing, they argue, is now less about controlling crime and more about detecting and managing risks. Mostly it involves communicating knowledge about risk to other institutions in society that demand such information (Ericson and Haggerty, 1997).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to this view, police are primarily “knowledge workers,” spending time processing information, drafting reports, or communicating data. Consider the “simple” case of an automobile accident in Ontario, Canada. A police officer is called to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_228" title="228"></span>scene of an automobile accident involving two vehicles, with minor injuries and one drunk driver. The investigation takes one hour; the drunk driver is criminally charged with the impaired operation of a motor vehicle, causing bodily harm, and operating a motor vehicle under the influence of excess alcohol. The driver’s license is automatically suspended for 12 hours.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Following this routine investigation, the officer spends 3 hours writing up 16 reports. Here, the role of police as brokers of information becomes clear:</p>
<ul class="contents">
<li class="bcpt"><span>The provincial motor registry requires information about the location of the accident and the vehicles and people involved. This registry is used for risk profiling in accident-prevention initiatives, traffic management, and resource allocation.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>The automobile industry needs to know about the vehicles involved to improve safety standards, report to regulatory agencies, and provide safety information to consumer groups.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>The insurance companies involved need information to determine responsibility and make awards in the case. They also require police information to develop statistical profiles of risk to set premiums and compensation levels for clients.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>The public health system requires details on the injuries. This knowledge is used for statistical profiles and to plan emergency-service provision.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>The criminal courts require police information as material for the prosecution and as proof that the police properly investigated the scene and collected evidence.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>The police administration itself requires reports on the incident for both internal records and national computer databases.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This example reveals how police work is increasingly about “mapping” and predicting risk within the population.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The informational demands of other institutions, such as the insurance industry, now require that police gather and report information in a way that is compatible with the needs of outside agencies. Computerized systems and forms define the way in which police report information. Rather than writing narrative accounts, police input the facts of a case into standardized forms by checking off boxes and choosing among available options. The information is used to categorize people and events as part of creating risk profiles. But such close-ended reporting formats influence what police observe and investigate, how they understand and interpret an incident, and the approach they take in resolving a problem. This emphasis on information collection and processing can alienate and frustrate many police officers, who see a distinction between “real” police work (e.g., investigating crimes) and the bureaucratic “donkey work” of reports and paper trails.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In recent years, several high-profile court cases have attracted mainstream media attention around stop-and-frisk policies in major American cities. These policies work to put a visible police presence in communities with high crime rates by temporarily detaining and questioning individuals at an officer’s discretion. In a decision declaring New York’s stop-and-frisk policy to be unconstitutional, federal judge Shira A. Scheindlin declared that the frequent stops made by N.Y. police were in violation of the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. Judge Scheindlin’s decision asks us to consider the effects of such policies in <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_229" title="229"></span>communities where individuals of color—overwhelmingly young men of color—are targeted by police officials on a near daily basis.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In <i class="italic">Punished: Policing the Lives of Black and Latino Boys</i> (2011)<i class="italic">,</i> sociologist Victor Rios describes the lived experience of young Black and Hispanic American men in Oakland, California. While Rios discusses much broader themes related to the policing of young men of color, temporary detainment policies such as stop and frisk contribute significantly to the “mass and ubiquitous criminalization of marginalized young people” (Rios, 2011). Rios documents the strain that policies like stop and frisk place on heavily policed communities, and how young men respond to the pervasive presence of police and other authority figures in their schools and neighborhoods. For the men in Rios’s study, negative interactions with police officers are a regular occurrence. These policies affect not only their daily lives but also the way in which they perceive themselves and their long-term life trajectories. Punitive policing created a culture of mistrust and resistance to authority, and even those who seldom broke the rules were perceived negatively by others in their community. In this setting, teachers and potential employers often interpreted innocuous behavior as acts of deviance or criminal activity and denied the young men access to the resources that could have helped them grow in positive ways.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, governments eager to appear decisive on crime favor work to increase the number and resources of the police. But it is not clear that a greater police presence translates into lower crime rates. In the United States, official statistics on violent crime rates and number of police cast doubt on such a link (Figure 7.7). This finding raises puzzling questions: If increased policing does not prevent violent crime, why does the public demand a visible police presence? What role does policing play in our society, and what role should it play?</p>
