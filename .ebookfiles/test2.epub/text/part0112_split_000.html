<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The resurgence of religion throughout the world has posed some challenges to the sociological study of religion. For much of the early twentieth century, it was widely argued that the rise of science, technology, and the critical thinking associated with modernity would prove a decisive challenge to religious thought, which is based in large part on faith rather than scientifically acceptable standards of evidence. Yet religious beliefs, in all religions, have proven to be remarkably durable. This raises a number of important questions that have yet to be conclusively answered by the sociology of religion.</p>
