<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Religion is one of the oldest human institutions. According to anthropologists, there have probably been about 100,000 religions throughout human history (Hadden, 1997a). When sociologists study religion, they hope to better understand its historical and contemporary role in shaping society and, conversely, the historical and contemporary social forces that shape religion itself (Hamilton, 2001).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists define <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-religion" href="part0109_split_004.html#religion">religion</a> as a cultural system of commonly shared beliefs and rituals that provides a sense of ultimate meaning and purpose by creating an idea of reality <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_656" title="656"></span>that is sacred, all-encompassing, and supernatural (Berger, 1967; Durkheim, 1965, orig. 1912; Wuthnow, 1988). There are three key elements in this definition:</p>
<ol class="fmnl">
<li class="bcpt" value="1">Religion is a form of culture, which consists of the shared beliefs, values, norms, and material conditions that create a common identity among a group of people. Religion has all these characteristics.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="2">Religion involves beliefs that take the form of ritualized practices—special activities in which believers take part and that identify them as members of the religious community.</li>
<li class="bcpt" value="3">Religion provides a feeling that life is ultimately meaningful. It does so by explaining coherently and compellingly what transcends or overshadows everyday life, in ways that other aspects of culture (such as an educational system or a belief in democracy) cannot (Geertz, 1973; Wuthnow, 1988).</li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What is absent from the sociological definition of religion is just as important as what is included: Nowhere is there mention of a god. We often think of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-theism" href="part0109_split_004.html#theism">theism</a>—a belief in one or more supernatural deities—as basic to religion, but this is not necessarily the case. As we shall see, some religions, such as Buddhism, believe in spiritual forces rather than a singular god.</p>
