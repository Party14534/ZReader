<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Can the Traditional Organization Survive?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Traditionally, identifying the boundaries of organizations has been fairly straightforward. Until recently, organizations were generally located in defined physical spaces, such as an office building, a suite of rooms, or, in the case of a hospital or university, a campus. In addition, the mission or tasks of an organization were usually clear-cut. A central feature of bureaucracies, for example, was adherence to a defined set of responsibilities and procedures for carrying them out. Weber’s bureaucracy was a self-contained unit that intersected with outside entities at limited and designated points.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We have already seen how the physical boundaries of organizations are being broken down by the capacity of information technology to transcend countries and time zones. The same process is affecting the work that organizations do and the way in which it is coordinated. Many organizations no longer operate as independent units. A growing number are finding that they run more effectively when they are part of a web of complex relationships with other organizations and companies. No longer is there a clear dividing line between the organization and outside groups. Globalization, information technology, and trends in occupational patterns mean that organizational boundaries are more open and fluid than they once were.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In <i class="italic">The Rise of the Network Society</i> (1996), Manuel Castells argues that the “network enterprise” is the organizational form best suited to a global, informational economy. By this he means that it is increasingly impossible for organizations (large corporations or small businesses) to survive if they are not part of a network. What enables networking to occur is the growth of information technology, whereby organizations around the world are able to enter into contact and coordinate joint activities through an electronic medium. Castells cites several examples of organizational networking that originated in diverse cultural and institutional contexts but nevertheless all represent what he calls “different dimensions of a fundamental process”—the disintegration of the traditional, rational bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Organizations can function as networks via the powerful alliances formed between top companies. Increasingly, the large corporation is less and less a big business and more an “enterprise web”—a central organization that links together smaller firms. IBM, for example, used to be a highly self-sufficient corporation, wary of partnerships with others. Yet in the 1980s and early 1990s, IBM joined with dozens of U.S.-based companies and more than 80 foreign-based firms to share strategic planning and cope with production problems.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Decentralization is another process that contributes to organizations functioning as networks. When change becomes more profound and more rapid, highly centralized Weberian-style bureaucracies are too cumbersome and too entrenched in their ways to cope. Stanley Davis (1988) argues that as business firms and other organizations come to be networks, they go through a process of decentralization by which power <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_193" title="193"></span>and responsibility are devolved downward throughout the organization, rather than remaining concentrated at the top.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Networked organizations offer at least two advantages over more bureaucratic ones: They can foster the flow of information, and they can enhance creativity. As we’ve seen, bureaucratic hierarchy can impede the flow of information: One must go through the proper channels, fill out the right forms, and avoid displeasing people in higher positions. These processes not only hinder the sharing of information but also stifle creative problem solving. In networked organizations, when a problem arises, instead of writing a memo to your boss and waiting for a reply, you can simply pick up the phone or dash off an email to the person responsible for working out a solution. As a result, members of networked organizations learn more easily from one another than do bureaucrats. It is therefore easier to solve routine dilemmas and to develop innovative solutions to all types of problems (Hamel, 1991; Powell and Brantley, 1992; Powell, Koput, and Smith-Doerr, 1996).</p>
