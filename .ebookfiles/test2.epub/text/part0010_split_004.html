<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">Social Change</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another question sociologists ask is how people live in light of the social transformations of their time. For today’s generation of college students and their parents, these questions will revolve around whether the world will ever be the same after the COVID-19 pandemic, but questions about social change go back to the beginnings of the field of sociology.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 1831, Alexis de Tocqueville, a French aristocrat and one of the first great social theorists, visited the United States from France. He wanted to understand how the conditions of democracy and equality were possible. Ever since the publication of his resulting study, <i class="italic">Democracy in America</i> (1969; orig. 1835), the United States has been viewed through the lens of sociology as a nation of joiners in which, more so than in Europe, people are involved in many groups and activities. Yet sociologists constantly revisit questions about whether the way we live today is different from how we lived in earlier times, and one of the enduring questions is whether Americans are less involved today in public-spirited activities than in the past.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another great theorist, Max Weber (1947; orig. 1922), looked at the way the world had been changing due to the influence of massive large-scale organizations, and how the emergence of an organizational society and large bureaucratic organizations had changed and transformed social life. Karl Marx, in <i class="italic">Capital</i> (1977; orig. 1867), examined how industrialization had changed the structure of an entire society, transforming the relationships of individuals to their work and to one another from feudalism to capitalism. Émile Durkheim, in <i class="italic">The Division of Labor in Society</i> (1964; orig. 1893), discussed how the historical changes wrought by industrialization and urbanization had led to the increasing specificity of the roles individuals filled, and how this specialization functioned to benefit society as a whole. These sound like abstract topics, but they were central to understanding how the world was changing at particular times.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In recent decades, sociologists have focused more and more on the rise of the Internet and how it has transformed everyday life. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many of these changes were not only on full display, but were transformed into a new social reality.</p>
