<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Education and literacy are important routes to economic development. Lower-income countries are therefore disadvantaged because they lack high-quality public education systems. Children in high-income countries get more schooling, and adults in those countries are more likely to be literate. While virtually all high schoolâ€“age males and females attend secondary school in high-income countries, in 2018, only 60 percent in lower-middle-income countries did so, and only 34 percent in low-income countries. In low-income countries, only 71 percent of males over 15 and 56 percent of females over 15 are able to read and write. The adult literacy rate in high-income countries, by way of comparison, is nearly 100 percent (World Bank, 2019d). One reason for these differences is that high-income countries spend a much larger percentage of their national income on education than do low-income countries, in large part because they can afford to do so.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Education is important for several reasons. First, it contributes to economic growth, because people with advanced schooling provide the skilled workforce necessary for high-wage industries. Second, education may offer some hope for escaping the cycle of harsh working conditions and poverty, although if there are no jobs to be had, even highly educated people may join the ranks of the poor and unemployed. Finally, educated people usually have fewer children, thereby slowing the global population explosion that contributes to global poverty (see <a href="part0121_split_000.html#3JCK20-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
