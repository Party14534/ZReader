<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When sociology began as a discipline, it was a highly theoretical field. It consisted of much armchair speculation, and many of the notions it developed about how the world worked were not well grounded in evidence. But in the 1920s, there developed in American sociology, largely at the University of Chicago, a more intense commitment to the idea that such theoretical speculations were not enough—that sociology as a discipline needed to ground its concepts and theories in facts and data.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This goal for sociology was represented in two figures, both of whom were professors at the University of Chicago: Robert Park (1864–1944) and William Ogburn (1886–1959). Park’s beliefs about how to make social research more scientific came from his background, both as a student of philosophy in Europe and as a reporter for the <i class="italic">Minneapolis Star</i>. He was interested in developing theories but wanted them to relate directly to the actual lives of people and to be based on the careful accumulation of evidence about people’s lives. He told his students that to do real research they needed to get the seat of their pants dirty, to wear out their shoe leather to discover the truth.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Park thought that the most important thing for a sociologist to do was to go around all the neighborhoods of the city and find out what was going on by meeting the people who were the subjects of the sociologists’ theories. Following Park’s lead, the University of Chicago’s sociology department used the city as a laboratory. Its sociologists took on roles in the community to see how the community’s members lived, conducting interviews and firsthand observations. Their research reports tended to be highly systematic, well written, and oriented toward improving conditions in the city and around the United States.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">William Ogburn, however, Park’s colleague in the department of sociology at the University of Chicago, didn’t believe that the future of sociology lay in shoe leather, well-written books, findings that could not be quantified, or efforts to influence public policy. These, he thought, were the domain of ethics, religion, journalism, and propaganda. In his presidential address to the American Sociological Society, he argued that sociology needed to become a science (Ogburn, 1930). The goal, he argued, was not “to make the world a better <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_38" title="38"></span>place in which to live” or to set forth “impressions of life” or to “[guide] the ship of state” but only to “[discover] new knowledge.” Ogburn wanted sociology to be a field that looked a lot more like the natural sciences in both its presentation and its orientation. Whereas Park had clear ideas about what the subject matter of sociology should be (immigration and the life of the city), Ogburn believed sociologists could study anything that could be measured with numbers.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These two figures, Park and Ogburn, coexisted at the University of Chicago for many years, each committed to his own vision of sociology as a science. For Park and his students, the personal, emotional, and scientific side of sociology complemented the aspiration to develop explanations about the social world. We can see this legacy in the work of young sociologists today. But the legacy of William Ogburn is no less significant. The value of statistics and scientific methodologies for understanding the world has never been greater, in part because of the massive amount of data and information being collected on the Internet. More than ever before, business and government need people who can analyze this material and who are disposed to think about the world in a scientific way.</p>
