<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Can Sociology Identify Causes and Effects?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the main problems faced in research methodology is the analysis of cause and effect. One difficult causal relationship to understand is an association in which one social context produces a certain effect. For example, if you live in a poor neighborhood, some sociologists think you are more likely to be unemployed or obese. But is the neighborhood the cause, or is it the other way around? Isnâ€™t it also possible that the kinds of people who would be unemployed or obese tend to gravitate toward living in certain kinds of neighborhoods? Although one of the main tasks of sociology is to identify causes and effects, there is a crisis of confidence among many scholars that such a goal is not as easily attained as once thought.</p>
