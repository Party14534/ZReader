<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Kingsley Davis and Wilbert E. Moore (1945) provided a functionalist explanation for stratification, arguing that it has beneficial consequences for society. They claimed that certain occupations in society, such as brain surgeons, are functionally more important than others, and that these positions require special skills. However, only a few individuals have the talents or experience appropriate to these positions. To attract the most qualified people, rewards need to be offered, such as money, power, and prestige. Davis and Moore determined that because the benefits of different positions in any society must be unequal, all societies must be stratified. They concluded that social stratification and social inequality are functional because they ensure that the most qualified people, attracted by the rewards society bestows, will fill the roles that are most important to a smoothly functioning society.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Davis and Moore’s theory suggests that a person’s social position is based solely on innate talents and efforts. It is not surprising that other sociologists have criticized their theory. For example, Melvin Tumin (1953) argued that the functional importance of a <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_253" title="253"></span>particular role is difficult to measure and that the social rewards bestowed on those in “important” roles do not reflect these people’s actual importance. For instance, who is more important, a lawyer or a schoolteacher? If, on average, a lawyer earns four or five times the amount that a schoolteacher earns, does that earning potential accurately reflect his or her relative importance to society?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Tumin also argued that Davis and Moore overlooked the ways in which stratification limits the discovery of talent in a society. As we have seen, the United States is not entirely a meritocratic society. Those at the top have special access to economic and cultural resources, such as the highest-quality education that helps transmit their privileged status from one generation to the next. For those—even those with superior talents—who lack access to these resources, social inequality is a barrier to reaching their full potential.</p>
