<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_5">Nancy Chodorow’s Theory of Gender Identity</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although many writers have used Freud’s approach in studying gender development, they have modified it in major respects. An important example is the sociologist Nancy Chodorow (1978, 1988), who argues that learning to feel male or female derives from the infant’s attachment to the parents from an early age. Children become emotionally involved with the mother because she is the most dominant influence in their early lives. At some point, this attachment has to be broken for the child to achieve a separate sense of self—to become less closely dependent.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Chodorow argues that the breaking process occurs in a different way for boys and girls. Girls remain closer to the mother—able, for example, to go on hugging and kissing her and imitating what she does. Because there is no sharp break from the mother, the girl, and later the adult woman, develops a sense of self that is more continuous with other people. Her identity is more likely to be merged with or depend on another’s: first her mother’s, later a man’s. In Chodorow’s view, this process of development fosters sensitivity and emotional compassion in women.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Boys gain a sense of self via a more radical rejection of their original closeness to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_119" title="119"></span>mother, forging their understanding of masculinity from what is not feminine. They learn not to be “sissies” or “mama’s boys.” As a result, boys are relatively unskilled in relating closely to others; they develop more analytical ways of looking at the world. They take a more active view of their lives, emphasizing achievement, but they have repressed their ability to understand their own feelings and those of others.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Chodorow’s work has met with various criticisms. Janet Sayers (1986), for example, has suggested that Chodorow does not explain the struggle of women, particularly in current times, to become autonomous, independent beings. Women (and men), Sayers points out, are more contradictory in their psychological makeup than Chodorow’s theory suggests. Femininity may conceal feelings of aggressiveness or assertiveness, which are revealed only obliquely or in certain contexts (Brennan, 1988). Chodorow has also been criticized for her narrow conception of the family based on a White, middle-class model. What happens, for example, in one-parent households or, as in many Chicano communities, in families where children are cared for by more than one adult (Segura and Pierce, 1993)?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These criticisms don’t undermine Chodorow’s work, however. Her ideas remain important because they teach us a good deal about the nature of femininity and help us understand the origins of “male inexpressiveness”—the difficulty men have in revealing their feelings to others (Balswick, 1983).</p>
