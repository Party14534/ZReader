<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Since the beginning of the practice of agriculture thousands of years ago, human beings have left an imprint on nature. Hunting and gathering societies lived mainly in nature; they existed on what the natural environment provided and made little attempt to change the world around them. With the advent of agriculture, this situation was altered. For crops to grow, land must be cleared, trees cut down, and encroaching weeds and wild foliage kept at bay. Even primitive farming methods can lead to soil erosion. Once natural forests are cut down and clearings made, the wind may blow away the topsoil. The farming community then clears some fresh plots of land, and so the process goes on. Some landscapes that we today think of as natural, such as the rocky areas and scrubland in southwestern Greece, are actually the result of soil erosion farmers created 5,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet before the development of modern industry and its associated urbanization, nature dominated human life far more than human activities influenced nature. Today, the human onslaught on the environment is so intense that few natural processes are uninfluenced by human activity. Nearly all cultivable land is under agricultural production. What used to be almost inaccessible wildernesses are now often nature reserves, visited routinely by thousands of tourists. Modern industry, still expanding worldwide, has led to steeply climbing demands for sources of energy and raw materials. Yet the world’s supply of such energy sources and raw materials is limited, and some key resources are bound to run out if global consumption is not restricted. Even the world’s climate, as we shall see, has been affected by global industrialization and economic growth—and the world’s wealthiest countries have had the largest impact.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In this section we provide a brief history of urbanization across the globe, followed by an examination of recent urbanization in the United States and the Global South. We then turn to the major theme in this chapter: the effect of population growth, urbanization, and industrialization on our shared environment—the planet Earth.</p>
