<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">Security and Terrorism</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, the United States began building an encompassing security apparatus to protect the country against the specter of global terrorism. Today, many activities we would have once considered mundane—flying home for the holidays, using public transportation, or calling our loved ones—have become sites of increased security and surveillance. In airports, subways, and federal government buildings nationwide, technologies such as metal detectors and X-ray machines have become commonplace. Do these new security measures protect us against potential threats?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In <i class="italic">Against Security</i>, Harvey Molotch asks if the securitization of numerous public spaces across the United States has indeed created a safer society—or if it has instead made us more fearful and less safe (Molotch, 2012). Molotch studies new security techniques used in restrooms, airports, and even the former site of New York City’s Twin Towers to show how the United States has worked to create the appearance of order through the visible deployment of security personnel and surveillance technology. These extreme security measures treat all of us as potential deviants but have questionable value for weeding out those who may truly endanger public safety. Indeed, Molotch argues that measures like racial or physical profiling, designed to help security officers identify potentially dangerous individuals, can actually make it easier for those individuals to thwart security measures. For example, terrorists who know that wearing specific clothing, or being of a particular race or ethnicity, will make them more likely to be selected for additional security screening can simply send members of their organization who do not have these characteristics to avoid scrutiny. Thus, “if the profile is made into an official list, bad guys can use it to build their scheme”; in other words, profiling on the basis of specific characteristics can actually help people become deviants by showing them which rules they need to circumvent.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In response to these concerns, Molotch advocates for a more reasoned, empathetic approach to thinking about security. Molotch explains that “real security comes from the assemblage of artifacts, habits, and procedures, which mostly are already there” (217). Rather than designing security systems on the assumption that all individuals are potential deviants, he appeals to the human instinct toward “decency”—our natural instinct to help one another in times of need. Molotch argues that when people encounter someone who is drowning, they naturally throw a rope and do not need to be coerced to do so (193). As a result, measures that accord with the formal and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_217" title="217"></span>informal norms of decency upon which a society already relies will be most effective in preventing deviant behavior.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Molotch’s work suggests that our efforts to weed out deviants may not only be ineffective but may also make it more difficult to live together in a society. Our efforts to superimpose a foreign set of norms and regulations to create the appearance of security may dismantle the very mechanisms we already use to maintain social order. For example, consider a city neighborhood in which residents live in cramped, tenement-style housing amid shops and a bustling street life. Individuals of different income levels live together and intermingle with residents on the streets, including street vendors, panhandlers, and the homeless. Crowds gather on the sidewalks, a cacophony of languages emanates from the apartments, and vendors call out to potential customers passing by.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">To outsiders, this street scene might appear disorganized. They might wonder why police haven’t cleared the sidewalk of panhandlers and the homeless or forced vendors to hawk their goods elsewhere. Like the creation of security systems, one could imagine creating highly controlled public spaces and making them available only to certain kinds of residents in an attempt to eliminate this apparent disorder. However, to neighborhood residents who are familiar with one another, the busy street may be one of the safest places in the city. Here, children playing outdoors can rely on the supervision of a whole cast of neighborhood regulars, like shop owners, who help maintain order. Jane Jacobs explored this idea in depth in <i class="italic">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</i>, where she found that “the public peace . . . of cities is not kept primarily by the police. . . . It is kept primarily by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves” (Jacobs, 1961). Like Jacobs, Molotch believes that social order is best maintained by practices that individuals themselves negotiate rather than practices imposed by a higher authority.</p>
