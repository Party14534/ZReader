<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">The Political Participation of Women</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The early women’s movements saw the vote as both the symbol of political freedom and the means of achieving greater economic and social equality. In the United States, women did not get the right to vote until 1920; in France, not until 1944. Even today, in many countries, women do not have the same voting rights as men.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_476" title="476"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Women obtaining the vote has not greatly altered the nature of politics, although women’s votes did contribute significantly to Obama’s victory in 2008 and again in 2012. Women’s voting patterns, like those of men, are shaped by party preferences, policy options, and the choice of candidates. In the 2016 election, 54 percent of women voted for Clinton compared to 42 percent for Trump. The reverse was true for men, with 53 percent voting for Trump and 41 percent for Clinton (Pew Research Center, 2016a), suggesting a strong gender gap in the first U.S. election in which a major party presidential candidate was female. The overall female preference for Clinton reflects the fact that Black and Latino women overwhelmingly voted Democrat; a majority of White women (53 percent) voted for Trump, including 62 percent of White women without a college degree (Puglise, 2016; Malone, 2016). Clearly race, education, and party affiliation intersected with gender in determining the outcome of the election.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There has been much debate—most of it informed by speculation rather than systematic analysis of data—over the reasons that Clinton, who had been heavily favored by statisticians and pollsters right up to the election, lost to Trump. While the unwillingness of some voters to elect a woman president may have played a role, most likely the results reflected the fact that many voters were tired of both parties’ policies and wanted a change. Clinton, who had a long resume as an “insider” (the politically engaged wife of former President Bill Clinton, New York State senator, secretary of state under Obama) lost to Trump, the ultimate “outsider” candidate.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Women such as Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Nikki Haley now play central roles in American politics. Still, women remain <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_477" title="477"></span>underrepresented in government. In 2019, there were only 25 women in the Senate (out of 100 members) and only 106 in the House of Representatives, comprising almost 25 percent of total seats in Congress (Center for American Women and Politics, 2018). While these percentages might seem low, from a historical perspective, they represent a sea change in women’s roles in politics. Just 40 years ago, in 1970, there was only a single woman in the Senate and just 10 in the House.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Since 1990, female candidates have been successful when they have run for office. The critical factor seems to be that political parties (which are run largely by men) have not recruited as many women to run for office. The factors that impede women’s advancement in the economy also operate in the realm of politics. Rising within a political organization requires considerable effort and time, which women shouldering major domestic burdens can rarely generate. That is perhaps why women are more likely to run for local elected positions, such as city council or mayor, rather than for statewide or national offices, which would require them to relocate far from their families. But there may be an additional influence in political life, where a high level of power is concentrated: Perhaps men are especially reluctant to abandon their dominance in such a sphere.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The influence of women on U.S. politics cannot be assessed solely through voting patterns and elected officials. Feminist groups have influenced political life independently of the franchise, particularly in recent decades. Since the early 1960s, the National Organization for Women (NOW) and other women’s groups in the United States have been instrumental in the passing of equal opportunity acts and in getting a range of issues directly affecting women on the political agenda. Such issues include equal rights at work, the availability of abortion, changes in family and divorce laws, and lesbian rights. In 1973, women achieved a legal victory when the Supreme Court ruled in <i class="italic">Roe v. Wade</i> that women had a legal right to abortion. The 1989 Court ruling in <i class="italic">Webster v. Reproductive Health Services</i>, which placed restrictions on that right, caused a resurgence of involvement in the women’s movement.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although women in the United States may have achieved increased political power in recent decades, in terms of global comparisons, the country still has a long way to go. The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) compiles a ranking of 193 countries, based on the percentage of women in each country’s lower legislative house (comparable with the U.S. House of Representatives). As of February 2019, the United States ranked 76th, with almost 25 percent of combined House and Senate seats occupied by women. Rwanda—an African country where intertribal genocide claimed more than 800,000 lives in 1994—ranked first, with 56 percent of all seats held by women (IPU, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some 70 women have served as heads of state (as presidents or prime ministers) during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (Geiger and Kent, 2017). Bangladesh—a predominantly Muslim country with 156 million people—has had female heads of state for more than half of its 46 years, the longest period of any modern country. The current prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, first served from 1996 to 2001, and has again been serving since 2009; her political rival, Khaleda Zia, served from 1991 to 1996, and again from 2001 to 2006. Other predominantly Muslim nations that have had a female head of state include Pakistan, Turkey, Indonesia, Senegal, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, and Mauritius (Dalia G, 2015). As of December 2019, 22 countries had female leaders, including Germany (Angela Merkel), Norway (Erna Solberg), Jacinda Ardern (New Zealand), and Mette Frederiksen (Denmark).</p>
