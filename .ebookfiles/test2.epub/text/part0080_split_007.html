<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As more and more people live well beyond the age of retirement, they enter a new stage of life for which there are few socially prescribed roles (Moen, 1995). Many people can look forward to 10 or 20 years of relatively healthy living, free from the obligations of paid work and raising a family. Furthermore, the older population will be increasingly well educated because young people today are much more likely than their parents or grandparents to have gone to college. While only 28 percent of older adults had high school diplomas in 1970, 86 percent of older adults in 2016 were high school graduates (Administration for Community Living, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These trends suggest that older persons are much more likely to remain a part of mainstream society rather than to become isolated (Jarvis, 2007). It is important for older adults to maintain a readiness to learn, stimulated by participation in a wide variety of learning activities; this engagement can contribute to mental alertness, a positive psychological attitude, and even improved physical health (Findsen and Formosa, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many two-year and four-year colleges today recognize the importance of lifelong learning and offer tuition waivers for older adults. For example, 51 universities in the United States are classified as “age-friendly,” meaning that they abide by 10 principles focused on encouraging the participation of older adults in all the core activities of the university, including educational and research programs (Eisenberg, 2019). Community colleges also play an important role in lifelong learning. As noted by the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_443" title="443"></span>American Council on Education (2008), about half of college-going adults age 50 and older attend community colleges, primarily for fun, to connect with other people, and to retool for a new career.</p>
