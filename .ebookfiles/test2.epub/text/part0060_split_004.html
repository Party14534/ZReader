<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Based on the World Bank’s income categories, for the world as a whole, at least in terms of average incomes, there has been considerable progress over the last two decades. In only twenty years (1999–2019), the number of high-income countries has grown by 27; upper-middle-income countries by 20. As countries have moved up into the two upper-income categories, the number of lower-middle-income countries dropped by 10; low-income countries by 34 (Prydz and Wadhwa, 2019). And looking at the number of countries in each income category tells only part of the story, since when we look at the number of people in each category, the changes are even more striking. Twenty years ago, 60 percent of the world’s population lived in low-income countries; today, the figure is only 9 percent. The number of people living in lower-middle-income countries grew from 15 percent to 35 percent; the number living in upper-middle-income countries grew from 10 percent to 35 percent. Significantly, however, the number of people living in high-income countries has been fairly constant at 15–16 percent over the 20-year period: the richest tier of nations remains a fairly exclusive club (Prydz and Wadhwa, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Much of this upward movement of people is the result of the economic success of two highly populous countries, China and India, which together account for more than a third of the world’s population. After taking inflation into account, China’s average income in 1998 was $800; by 2018, it had grown to $9,460, an historically unprecedented twelve-fold increase in only 20 years. China moved from the bottom of the lower-middle-income category to the top of the upper-middle-income category, and is poised to quickly join the ranks of high-income countries. Since China’s 1.4 billion people account for nearly one out of every five persons on the planet, its economic success by itself has elevated a significant portion of the world population out of economic poverty. (We will focus on the reasons for China’s success later in this chapter.) India’s accomplishments are not quite as striking: Its average income grew from $410 in 1998 to $2,020 in 2018, a five-fold increase, enough to raise India from the low-income category to the lower-middle-income category—still a significant improvement for many of India’s 1.4 billion people (Prydz and Wadhwa, 2019).</p>
