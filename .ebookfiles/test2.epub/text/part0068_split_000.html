<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we have learned so far, gender is one of the main dimensions along which we differentiate humans in society. Yet men and women are not merely viewed as different in most societies; in many domains, men and women experience unequal treatment, with men consistently holding more political, economic, and social power. Male dominance in a society is patriarchy. Although men are favored in almost all societies, the degree of patriarchy varies. In the United States, women have made tremendous progress in education, work, politics, and economics, but several forms of gender inequality persist.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists define <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-gender-inequality" href="part0068_split_005.html#gender-inequality">gender inequality</a> as the difference in the status, power, and prestige that women and men have in groups, collectives, and societies. In the following sections, we will review contemporary research that documents both the magnitude of, and the explanations for, gendered inequalities across multiple domains, including education, the workplace, the family, and politics. We will focus primarily on the United States but will also demonstrate that the disparities in the United States pale in comparison to those in other nations, where the cultural devaluation of women is widespread.</p>
