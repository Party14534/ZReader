<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Obesity</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One major public health problem that sociologists have studied in recent years is obesity. In the United States today, the number of obese people has been growing steadily. More than one-third (39.8 percent) of American adults are obese, and 18.5 percent of children and teenagers ages 2 to 19 are obese (Hales et al., 2017). Although obesity may have a significant biological component, significant social factors should not be ignored. Most obviously, sociologists have discovered that particular communities, sometimes known as “food deserts,” are short of healthy food options. Poor inner-city neighborhoods tend to have fewer grocery stores and health food outlets, and more fast-food restaurants than do wealthier neighborhoods (Walker, Keane, and Burke, 2010). More controversial has been the finding by sociologist Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School and social scientist James Fowler of the University of California, Davis, that having fat friends can make you fat.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Their study, titled “The Spread of Obesity in a Large Social Network over 32 Years,” published in <i class="italic">The New England Journal of Medicine</i> (2007), showed that obesity was <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_187" title="187"></span>“contagious.” Christakis and Fowler found that if one person became obese, then persons closely connected to him or her had a greater chance of becoming obese. If a person once considered a “friend” became obese, then one’s own chances of becoming obese increased by 57 percent. However, a mere neighbor’s weight change had no effect on one’s body weight.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The media were eager to report the findings of the Christakis and Fowler study. It was the first-ever study to examine the ways that one’s social networks affected one’s body weight. The researchers had access to a unique data source that allowed them to ask questions such as, How do one’s friends affect one’s weight? Does it matter if one’s friends live nearby or far away? Christakis and Fowler analyzed data from a sample of 12,067 adults who were followed over a period of 32 years, from 1971 to 2003. These adults were participants in the renowned Framingham Heart Study. The data source revealed with whom the study participants were friends and who was a spouse or sibling or neighbor. It also obtained information on each person’s address and body weight at each interview point.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because of their unique data and rigorous methodology, the researchers could rule out competing explanations for their findings. For example, because they had data from many time points throughout the 32-year study, they could ascertain the order in which events unfolded. It was not the case that obese people would simply seek out similar-weight people as friends. Rather, Christakis noted, there was a “direct, causal relationship.” Christakis and Fowler also found that it didn’t matter whether one’s friend lived near or far; they found that a friend who lived 500 miles away had just as powerful an impact on one’s own weight as a friend who lived across the street.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The study also found that the “contagion” of body weight was not due to the fact that friends might share lifestyles, hobbies, and dietary choices—such as eating large meals together or discouraging one another from exercising. If it’s not the “birds of a feather flock together” explanation or “gluttony loves company” explanation, what accounts for the spread of body weight? The authors believe that their study is a testimony to the power of social norms. People develop their ideas about what is an acceptable body type by looking at the people around them. Christakis stated: “People come to think that it is okay to be bigger since those around them are bigger, and this sensibility spreads.”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">However, the researchers were adamant that Americans should not come away thinking that it is wise or healthy to abandon their obese friends. Rather, Christakis noted, it is good for one’s health to have friends, period: “It is unlikely that severing ties with people on the basis of any of their particular traits—as some have supposed that our results might suggest—would necessarily be beneficial.” Instead, they concluded that overweight or obese people could befriend a healthy-weighted person and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_188" title="188"></span>then allow themselves to be influenced by the positive model set by the healthy-weight friend.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Other researchers have criticized their methods. Lyons (2011) and other statisticians have argued in scathing critiques that the researchers did not properly use their statistics and that most of the association was due to error. However, even the most skeptical critics of Christakis and Fowler’s work do acknowledge that human health and health behaviors are powerfully shaped by one’s peers and significant others, although they would not go so far as to say that it is “contagion,” instead suggesting that people associate with others like themselves, or they may model and influence each other’s behaviors.</p>
