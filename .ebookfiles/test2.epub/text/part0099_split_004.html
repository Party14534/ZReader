<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Family life encompasses the whole range of emotional experience. Family relationships—between spouses or cohabiting romantic partners, parents and children, brothers and sisters, or more distant relatives—can be warm and fulfilling. But they can equally be extremely tense, driving people to despair or imbuing them with anxiety and guilt. The dark side of family life belies the rosy images of family harmony frequently depicted in TV shows and commercials. It can take many forms. Among the most devastating are the incestuous abuse of children and domestic violence.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Family Violence</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Violence within families is perpetuated primarily by men. The two broad categories of family violence are child abuse and intimate partner violence (IPV). Because of the sensitive and private nature of violence within families, it is difficult to obtain national <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_602" title="602"></span>data on levels of domestic violence. Data on child abuse are particularly sparse because of the cognitive development and ethical issues involved in studying child subjects. While family violence has been a concern throughout history, it was particularly acute during the COVID-19 pandemic, when stay-at-home orders meant that victims were essentially trapped at home with their abuser (Humphreys et al., 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Child Abuse</b> The most common definition of child abuse is serious physical harm (trauma, sexual abuse with injury, or willful malnutrition) with intent to injure. One national study of married or cohabiting adults indicated that about 3 percent of respondents abused their children, though cohabiting adults were no more or less likely to abuse their children than married couples (Brown, 2004; Sedlak and Broadhurst, 1996).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">More recent statistics are based on national surveys of child-welfare professionals. However, these surveys miss children who are not seen by professionals or who are not reported to state agencies. Researchers estimate that as many as 50 to 60 percent of child deaths from abuse or neglect are not recorded (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 2008). Statistics based on the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System indicate that in 2018, an estimated 678,000 children were victims of abuse or neglect. Of these, 60.8 percent suffered neglect, 10.7 percent suffered physical abuse, and 7 percent were sexually abused; 77.5 percent of victims were maltreated by their parents. American Indian or Alaska Native children suffered the highest rate of abuse at 15.2 per 1,000 children in the population of the same race or ethnicity. Black children experienced the second highest rate at 14.0 per 1,000 children of the same race or ethnicity (Children’s Bureau, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The effects of child abuse can linger for years, if not decades, after the child escapes the abusive situation. Recent studies show that adult men and women who suffered physical or sexual abuse in childhood are at elevated risk of multiple health conditions in midlife, including depression, chronic pain (Goldberg, 1994), sleep problems (Greenfield et al., 2011), and metabolic syndrome (Lee, Tsenkova, and Carr, 2014). Some evidence also suggests that victims of child abuse are more likely to commit abuse against partners and their own children, thus amplifying and perpetuating the cycle of abuse for future generations (Widom, Czaja, and DuMont, 2015).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Intimate Partner Violence</b> Abuse of one’s spouse or romantic partner is widespread in the United States. A 1985 study by Murray Straus and his colleagues found that IPV had occurred at least once in the past year in 16 percent of all marriages and at some point in the marriage in 28 percent of all marriages. This study does not, however, distinguish between severe acts, such as beating up and threatening with <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_603" title="603"></span>or using a gun or knife, and less severe acts, such as slapping, pushing, grabbing, or shoving. When the authors disaggregated this number, they found that approximately 3 percent of all husbands admitted perpetrating at least one act of severe violence on their spouse in the previous year; this figure is likely an underestimate.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">More recent data, based on the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS), found even higher rates of severe violence, although these data refer to abuse among both married and nonmarried romantic partners. For instance, these data from 2011 show that 16 percent of women and 10 percent of men had experienced sexual violence by an intimate partner during their lifetimes. Severe physical violence by an intimate partner (including acts such as being hit with something hard, being kicked or beaten, or being burned on purpose) was reported by 22 percent of women and 14 percent of men during their lifetimes (Breiding et al., 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Trend data can tell us about the prevalence of IPV, but not the nature of or context giving rise to abuse. Michael Johnson (1995) has identified two broad types of IPV: “patriarchal terrorism,” which is perpetuated by feelings of power and control, versus “common couple violence,” which generally relates to a specific incident and is not rooted in power or control. Sociological studies show that IPV is closely related to structural factors, including low levels of power among women, and cultural factors, including widespread acceptance of violence and beliefs that male power is equated with violence (Jewkes, 2002). Violence is particularly likely to occur among couples whose relationships are marked by conflict, especially conflicts about finances, jealousy, substance use, and the husband’s belief that his wife is violating traditional gender roles. Women who are more empowered educationally, economically, and socially are most protected from IPV (Jewkes, 2002).</p>
