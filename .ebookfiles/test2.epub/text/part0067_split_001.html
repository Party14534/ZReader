<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Functionalist Approaches</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Functionalist approaches see society as a system of interlinked parts that, when in balance, operate smoothly to produce social solidarity. Thus, functionalist and functionalist-inspired perspectives on gender argue that gender differences, and, specifically, men’s and women’s specialization in different tasks, contribute to social stability and integration. Though popular in the 1950s and 1960s, these perspectives have been heavily criticized for neglecting social tensions at the expense of consensus and for perpetuating a conservative view of the social world.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Scholars who support the concept of natural differences argue that women and men perform those tasks for which they are biologically best suited. The anthropologist George Murdock (1949) saw it as practical and convenient that women should concentrate on domestic and family responsibilities while men worked outside the home. On the basis of a cross-cultural study of more than 200 societies, Murdock concluded that the sexual division of labor is present in all cultures and that, although not the result of biological programming, it is the most logical and efficient basis for the organization of society.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologist Talcott Parsons studied the role of the family in industrial societies (Parsons and Bales, 1955). He was particularly interested in the socialization of children and believed that stable, supportive families were the key to successful socialization. He saw the family as operating most efficiently with a clear-cut sexual division of labor in which women carry out <i class="italic">expressive</i> roles, providing care and security to children and offering them emotional support, and men perform an <i class="italic">instrumental</i> role—namely, being the breadwinner. Because of the stressful nature of men’s role, women’s expressive and nurturing tendencies should also be used to comfort and care for men. This complementary division of labor, springing from a biological distinction between the sexes, would ensure the solidarity and stability of the family, according to Parsons.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another perspective on gender differences that is consistent with core themes of functionalist theories is attachment theory, advanced by psychologist John Bowlby (1953). Bowlby argued that the mother is crucial to the primary socialization of children. If the mother is absent or if a child is separated from the mother at a young age, the child may be inadequately socialized. This can lead to serious social and psychological difficulties later in life, including antisocial and psychopathic tendencies. Bowlby argued that a child’s well-being and mental health require a close, personal, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_339" title="339"></span>and continuous relationship with the mother or a female mother substitute. Some have used Bowlby’s maternal deprivation thesis to argue that working mothers are neglectful of their children.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Feminists have sharply criticized claims of a biological basis for the sexual division of labor, arguing that there is nothing natural or inevitable about the allocation of tasks in society. Women are not prevented from pursuing occupations on the basis of biological features; rather, humans are socialized into roles that are culturally expected. Further, a steady stream of evidence suggests that the maternal deprivation thesis is questionable; studies have shown that children’s educational performance and personal development are in fact enhanced when both parents work outside the home at least part of the time (e.g., Brooks-Gunn, Han, and Waldfogel, 2010).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Parsons’s notion of the “expressive” female has also been attacked for implicitly condoning the subordination of women in the home. There is no basis for the belief that the “expressive” female is necessary for the smooth operation of the family—rather, the role is promoted largely for the convenience of men.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In addition, cross-cultural studies show that societies vary greatly in terms of the degree to which they differentiate and assign tasks as being exclusively men’s or women’s (Baxter, 1997; Gornick and Meyers, 2003). The extent to which certain tasks can be shared, and even how open groups and societies are to women performing men’s activities and roles, differs across cultures, across time, and in different political and economic contexts. Finally, cultures differ in the degree to which men are seen as “naturally” dominant over women. Thus, gender inequalities do not seem to be fixed or static.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Biological determinists see gender inequalities and differences based on gender as inevitable and unchangeable because they are consequences of biological necessities, not of social processes. Feminist scholars do not deny that men and women have distinctive biological characteristics, yet they argue that physical differences alone cannot explain the stark gender differences in men’s and women’s social and economic roles (e.g., Grosz, 1994). Sociological approaches, in general, hold that society, more than biology, guides gendered roles, interactions, and status differences today. Sociologists also emphasize that gender inequality is tied to issues of race and class. Women—rich and poor, Black and White, immigrant and native born—may share similar biological characteristics, yet their social experiences are vastly different (Rothenberg, 2007).</p>
