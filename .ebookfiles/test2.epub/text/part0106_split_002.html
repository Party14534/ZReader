<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Is Homeschooling a Substitute for Traditional Schooling?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Homeschooling has increased dramatically in popularity in recent decades. An estimated 1.8 million (or 3.4 percent of all) children are currently homeschooled, up from 850,000 children (1.7 percent) in 1999 (Murphy, 2012; Redford, Battle, and Bielick, 2017). Homeschooling means that a child is taught by his or her parents, guardians, or a team of adults who oversee the child’s educational development. The curricula that homeschooled children follow vary widely from state to state, with some states mandating quite strict ones and others far more lax ones, offering parents greater leeway.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A recent survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education queried parents about their motivation for homeschooling their children. The most frequently cited reasons were a concern about the school environment (91 percent), a desire to provide moral instruction (77 percent), and dissatisfaction with the academic instruction at other schools (74 percent) (Redford, Battle, and Bielick, 2017). It remains to be seen how well homeschooling prepares young adults for the future challenges of college or employment in the United States. Some studies suggest that homeschooled children are just as well prepared for college as their traditionally educated counterparts, while others say that homeschooling deprives children of important life lessons.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Before we can ascertain whether homeschooling is beneficial, we need to consider that homeschooling is a “selective” process, and the traits that “select” people into homeschooling may also affect their later prospects. White students have a higher homeschooling rate than Blacks and Hispanics; fully 59 percent of homeschooled students in 2016 were White (NCES, 2018a). In addition, students in two-parent households make up 80 percent of the homeschooled population, and those in two-parent households with one parent in the labor force make up 55 percent of the homeschooled population (NCES, 2018a). Students in households earning between $25,001 and $75,000 per year had higher rates of homeschooling than their peers in households earning $25,000 or less a year. Thus, many children who are homeschooled have several social advantages, including wealthier or more stable families.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The impossibility of homeschooling a larger segment of the population became evident during the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic, when parents across the United States were unexpectedly forced to play a far more significant role in their children’s education after K-12 schools closed their doors for an undetermined period. Although classes were conducted remotely, via online platforms, television broadcasts, and paper pamphlets, parents were called on to supervise their children’s progress and assume many of the responsibilities of teachers. Those with the homeschooling experience suddenly became wellsprings of information and advice (Kamenetz and Turner, 2020; Rummel, 2020; Willen, 2020), which, however well-intentioned, was often irrelevant or useless to parents without the knowledge, temperament, and vocation of professional educators (Long, 2020). Those able to hold on to their jobs by working remotely had to find ways to juggle their professional responsibilities, the regular duties of parenting, and their children’s education. Those laid off from their jobs had the stress of dealing with financial hardship, job hunting, and an uncertain future. This is not to mention the many households affected by the virus itself, who were forced into collective quarantine or flung into mourning for a victim of the pandemic.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although the situation was difficult for most working parents, those of comfortable means generally had the educational background, the resources, and physical space <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_645" title="645"></span>to provide proper supervisions for their children and cope with homeschooling for an extended time. Those without these luxuries were often at a loss: How could they teach a subject of which they had no knowledge? How could they find a quiet place for their children to study in a crowded inner-city apartment shared by extended family? How could they maintain discipline at home and ensure that each child got equal time to do their work on a shared device? How did one deal with disruptions by other family members, emotionally unstable neighbors, noise in the corridors, etc.? Homeschooling, even on a part-time basis, was not a viable option for households struggling with these problems.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Parents who were called on to homeschool students with disabilities were especially hard hit as teachers were not required to provide them with Individualized Educational Plans (IEPs) once schools shut their doors. Even when they did, many parents lacked the proper training or time to provide or keep up with the special needs of their children, whose conditions were in danger of rapid regression if their carefully structured schedules unraveled (Chiavaroli, 2020). In other cases, it was the parent who suffered from a disability or debilitating illness, and who now faced the challenge of supplementing their child’s (or children’s) education all day long for weeks on end (Panico and Duhart, 2020).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The frustration, even exasperation voiced by parents throughout the pandemic bore witness to the fact that homeschooling, however successful for a small minority, is not an effective alternative for the population at large.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is much harder to ascertain whether homeschooled children fare better on outcomes such as standardized test scores or success in college because little data are available on these topics. Most studies concluding that homeschoolers outperform traditional students are criticized on the grounds that they are focused on biased samples (e.g., Oplinger and Willard, 2004; Rudner, 1999). Experts also argue that it is hard to describe definitively the experience of homeschoolers because they are such a diverse group, representing every possible religious, political, and spiritual orientation (Murphy, 2012).</p>
