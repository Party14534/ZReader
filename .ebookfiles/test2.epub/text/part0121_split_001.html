<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">At the time of Christ’s birth roughly 2,000 years ago, there were roughly 300 million people in the entire world—fewer than the 330 million who live in the United States today (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018b). It took nearly all of human history to add the first billion people to our planet, a number that was reached only two centuries ago, around 1800. It took another 130 years (until 1930) to add the second billion, 30 years (until 1960) to add the third billion, 15 years (until 1975) to add the fourth billion. Since that time, every twelve years the world’s population has added another billion people, reaching 7 billion in 2011 (to signal this momentous event, the United Nations designated Danica May Camacho, born in the Philippines on October 31, as “baby number 7 billion”). By the time you are reading this textbook, the global population will have grown to 7.7 billion. Such rapid growth has enormous implications for the way people live, for the quality of their lives. Indeed, as humans transform the earth’s forests and savannahs into giant cities and farms, there is widespread agreement among climate scientists that the entire planet is under threat.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is difficult to predict with any precision the rate at which the world population will rise, but United Nations researchers have produced several scenarios based on recent trends. Their most likely estimate assumes “medium” levels of fertility: roughly two children being born, on average, to women throughout the world. (Obviously, some women will have more children and some fewer; this is an estimated average.) According to this scenario, the world population will reach 9.7 billion people by 2050 before stabilizing at 10.9 billion by the end of the century. The correct answer, then, is 9–10 billion, at the low end of the choices in our opening quiz (UNDESA, 2019). This may seem like good news: The rate of population growth appears to have slowed quite a bit. Instead of adding a billion people every 12 years, over the next three decades a billion will be added every fifteen years.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Unfortunately, this slowdown is not as hopeful as it seems. Unless there are changes in the way humans live, even current population levels—much less adding billions more people to the planet—may prove unsustainable. In this <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_763" title="763"></span>chapter, we will examine the ways in which people are affecting the planet. We will begin by looking at population growth, since more people mean additional demands on planetary resources. We will then examine urbanization, the “built environment” in which rapidly growing populations live, and which has significant impacts on the natural environment. The combined forces of urbanization, industrialization (previously discussed in <a href="part0090_split_000.html#2LQIK0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 14</a>), and population growth now threaten to result in major environmental changes throughout the planet—changes that will be most strongly felt throughout your lives after college.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We will examine these changes in detail, and how they might be best addressed through the lens of sociology. We conclude with two unanswered questions—one concerning the likely relationship between global population growth and global food production, the other asking whether current efforts to address the major environmental changes that are occurring are likely to be successful, or if some other radically different approaches are needed.</p>
