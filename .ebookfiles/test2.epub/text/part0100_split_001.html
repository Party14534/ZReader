<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Is Cohabitation a Substitute for Marriage?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">If current statistics are any indicator, roughly half of all students reading this textbook will live with their romantic partner before marrying. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-cohabitation" href="part0100_split_004.html#cohabitation">Cohabitation</a>—in which a couple lives together in a sexual relationship without being married—has become increasingly widespread in most Western societies. Until a few decades ago, cohabitation was regarded as somewhat scandalous, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_604" title="604"></span>but during the 1980s, the number of unmarried men and women sharing a household went up sharply. The proportion of young couples who cohabit has risen from 11 percent in the early 1970s to 44 percent in the early 1980s and slightly below 50 percent by 2013 (Copen, Daniels, and Mosher, 2013). Cohabitation has become widespread among college and university students, although they did not initiate this trend. Larry Bumpass and coworkers (Bumpass, Sweet, and Cherlin, 1991) found that the cohabitation phenomenon started with lower-educated groups in the 1950s—probably as a substitute for marriage, which may involve economic constraints.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While, for some, cohabitation today may be a substitute for marriage, for many, it is a stage in the process of relationship building that precedes marriage. Young people usually come to live together by drifting into it, rather than through calculated planning. A couple having a sexual relationship spend increasing time together, eventually giving up one of their individual homes. While in the 1980s and 1990s, cohabiting couples said their main reason for cohabiting was to “be sure they are compatible before marriage” (Bumpass, Sweet, and Cherlin, 1991), very different reasons are given by cohabiters in the early twenty-first century. One study of cohabiters found that the main reasons a couple moved in together were because the partners “loved spending time together” and to share love, intimacy, and space (see Table 15.2) (Rhoades, Stanley, and Markman, 2009).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Gender differences have been found when it comes to the reasons cited for cohabiting. One recent study conducted focus group interviews with cohabiting men and women and found that both genders said their primary motives for cohabiting included spending time together and evaluating compatibility. Men, however, were concerned about the loss of freedom that would come with marriage whereas women worried that cohabitation would further delay marriage. One of the most important factors for lower-income young adults is money; sharing an apartment helps save money, and cohabiting pushes off the expenses of a wedding (Huang et al., 2011; Sassler and Miller, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For most couples, cohabitation is a temporary state—leading either to marriage or a breakup. The likelihood that cohabitation leads to marriage has diminished for recent cohorts, while the chances that a cohabiting union breaks up has increased. Mernitz (2018) studied two cohorts of cohabitors, one born in the early 1980s and the other born in the late 1950s through early 1960s. Only one-third of the younger cohort of cohabiters married within five years of entering their union, compared to 41 percent among the older cohort. Similarly, younger cohorts are more likely to see their cohabiting union breakup (Guzzo, 2014; Kuo and Raley, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The chances of a cohabiting union transitioning to a first marriage are related to several socioeconomic factors. For instance, White cohabiting couples are more likely than their Black or Latinx counterparts to marry within three years. The likelihood of a first marriage resulting from cohabitation is positively associated with higher education, the absence of children during cohabitation, and higher family income. It is also more likely in communities with low male unemployment rates (Copen, Daniels, and Mosher, 2013; Bramlett and Mosher, 2002). These data are consistent with the claim that marriage vis à vis cohabitation has become an institution of economic and racial privilege (Cherlin, 2009; Sassler and Miller, 2018)</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Increasingly, evidence shows that rather than being a “stage in the process” between dating and marriage, cohabitation may be an end in itself. For a very small subset, cohabitation is preferable to marriage. Long-time cohabiters with no plans to marry say <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_605" title="605"></span>that they prefer cohabitation due to their unease about the meanings associated with marriage and concerns about what marriage does to the relationship (Hatch, 2015).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For a rapidly growing number of couples, cohabitation is “marriage-like” in that it is a context for bearing and rearing children. In the early 1980s, 29 percent of all nonmarital births were to those in cohabiting unions. Recent estimates suggest that 62 percent of births to never-married women are to women in a cohabiting union (Lamidi, 2016). However, White and Latinx women are much more likely than Black women to have a birth in the context of a cohabiting relationship (Payne et al., 2012). Part of the reason more babies are born into cohabiting unions is that pregnant women today don’t feel the same social pressure to marry their partner as they would have in past years. In the past, couples who got pregnant before they were married might have had a “shotgun” <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_606" title="606"></span>marriage before the birth of the baby. Currently, however, only 11 percent of single women who have a pregnancy that results in a live birth are married by the time the child is born. Fewer unmarried couples—whether cohabiting or not—are marrying before the birth of their child. There has, however, been an increase in the rate at which unmarried women begin cohabiting with their partner once they find out they are pregnant: Currently, 11 percent of single women who have a pregnancy that results in a live birth begin cohabiting by the time the baby is born—the same number as marry to “legitimate” a pregnancy.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although cohabitation is increasingly like marriage in that couples enter into it for love, companionship, support, and child-rearing, it does differ from marriage in one important way: Cohabitation is less stable than marriage. Whereas the likelihood of a first marriage ending in separation or divorce within 5 years is 20 percent, there is a 49 percent chance that a premarital cohabitation will break up within 5 years. Similarly, after 10 years, the probability of a first marriage ending is 33 percent, compared with 62 percent for cohabitations (Bramlett and Mosher, 2002). Because cohabiting unions tend to be less stable than marriage, children born to cohabiting parents experience family instability which can undermine their emotional and cognitive well-being (Manning, 2015). Part of this association is due to social selection; as we noted earlier, cohabiting families are more likely than married families to be poor, and poverty harms children in many ways. Cohabiting parents also tend to have less formal education—a key indicator of both economic and social resources—than married parents do. And cohabiting parent families don’t have the same legal protections that married parent families have. However, more fine-grained analyses show that stable cohabiting families with two biological parents offer many of the same health, cognitive, and behavioral benefits that stable married biological parent families provide. Overall, scholars tend to believe that cohabitation is a highly varied experience, with some enjoying long-term satisfying unions that are “marriage-like” and provide a stable environment for their children, whereas with others living together as a trial, treating cohabitation as a more serious form of “dating.”</p>
