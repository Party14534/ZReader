<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Gender Socialization: How Gender Differences Are Learned</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we noted earlier, gender role socialization describes the processes through which we learn what it means to be “male” or “female” in our society. This approach distinguishes between biological sex and social gender—an infant is born with a sex and develops a gender. Children are guided in this process by positive and negative sanctions, that is, socially applied forces that reward or restrain behavior. For example, a young boy could be positively sanctioned for complying with masculine expectations (“What a brave boy you are!”) or negatively sanctioned for violating these expectations (“Boys don’t play with dolls. What are you, a sissy?”). Historically, if an individual developed gender practices that did not correspond with his or her biological sex, the explanation given was inadequate socialization. According to functionalist perspectives, socializing agents help maintain the smooth continuation of the existing social order by overseeing the smooth gender socialization of new generations. (See <a href="part0009_split_000.html#8IL20-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 1</a> for a review of the core themes of functionalism.)</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Functionalist perspectives prevailed during the mid-twentieth century, yet in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, this rigid interpretation of sex roles and socialization has been criticized on a number of fronts. Many writers argue that gender socialization is not an inherently smooth process; different agents, such as families, schools, and peer groups, may be at odds with one another. Moreover, socialization theories ignore individuals’ ability to reject or modify the social expectations <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_332" title="332"></span>surrounding sex roles. Humans are not passive objects or unquestioning recipients of gender programming, as some sociologists have suggested. People actively create and modify roles for themselves. Gender is a product of individual choices and preferences, as well as social, contextual, and biological influences.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Consider the following two scenes. Two newborns, a few hours old, lie in the nursery of a hospital maternity ward. One, a male, is wrapped in a blue blanket; the other, a female, is in a pink blanket. Their respective grandparents are seeing them for the first time. The conversation between one pair of grandparents runs along these lines:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><span>Grandma A:</span> There he is—our first grandchild, and a boy.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><span>Grandpa A:</span> Hey, isn’t he a hefty little fellow? Look at that fist he’s making. He’s going to be a regular little fighter, that guy is. (Grandpa A smiles and throws out a boxing jab to his grandson.) Atta boy! [ . . . ]</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><span>Grandma A:</span> Let’s go and congratulate the parents. I know they’re thrilled about little Fred. They wanted a boy first.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><span>Grandpa A:</span> Yeah, and they were sure it would be a boy, too, what with all that kicking and thumping going on even before he got here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When they depart to congratulate the parents, the grandparents of the other child arrive. The dialogue between them goes like this:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><span>Grandma B:</span> There she is . . . the only one with a pink bow taped to her head. Isn’t she darling.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><span>Grandpa B:</span> Yeah—isn’t she little. Look at how tiny her fingers are. Oh, look—she’s trying to make a fist.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><span>Grandma B:</span> Isn’t she sweet . . . You know, I think she looks a little like me.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><span>Grandpa B:</span> Yeah, she sorta does. She has your chin.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><span>Grandma B:</span> Oh, look, she’s starting to cry . . . Poor little girl. (To the baby) There, there, we’ll try to help you.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><span>Grandpa B:</span> Let’s find the nurse. I don’t like to see her cry . . .</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><span>Grandma B:</span> Hmm. I wonder when they will have their next one. I know Fred would like a son, but little Fredericka is well and healthy. After all, that’s what really matters.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><span>Grandpa B:</span> They’re young yet. They have time for more kids. I’m thankful too that she’s healthy. (Walum, 1977)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The contrast between the two conversations sounds so exaggerated that it’s tempting to think they were made up. In fact, they are transcripts of actual dialogue recorded in a maternity ward. The first question usually asked of a new parent—in Western culture, at least—is “Is it a boy or a girl?” In fact, expectant parents today can buy over-the-counter tests to determine the sex of their fetus, and a recent trend is “gender reveal” parties, where expectant parents share pink or blue cakes with their friends as a celebratory way to announce the sex (O’Connor, 2012). The implication is that sex <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_333" title="333"></span>matters, because parents will raise boys and girls in different ways (Nugent, 2012). Once the infant is born and is marked as male or female, everyone who interacts with the child will treat it in accordance with its gender. They do so on the basis of the society’s assumptions, which lead people to treat women and men differently, even as opposites, affirming the gender binary (Zosuls et al., 2009).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Clearly, gender socialization is very powerful, and challenges to it can be upsetting. Take the case of Baby Storm, for example. When Storm was born in 2011, the baby’s parents did not want to place a “male” or “female” label on their infant, recognizing that such an assignment would virtually guarantee that their baby would be treated in highly gender-typed ways. For the first few years of Storm’s life, the parents kept the baby’s sex a secret from everyone except their very closest family members. Their goal was to allow their child to express his or her gender freely and creatively. However, Storm’s parents, Kathy Witterick and David Stocker, found themselves at the center of an angry international debate and were accused of being psychologically abusive to their child and using Storm as part of an ill-advised social experiment. Two years later, Storm was reported to be a happily adjusted toddler; when a journalist asked about Storm’s gender, Witterick replied, “Sometimes Storm says, ‘I’m a girl,’ and sometimes Storm says, ‘I’m a boy’” (Poisson, 2013). Another three years later, when Storm was six, the child had “picked a pronoun—her gender identity is she,” according to her father. Storm’s parents thought that their unconventional approach to child-rearing was necessary to free their <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_334" title="334"></span>child from constraining and stifling gender expectations (Ostroff, 2016). As sociological studies repeatedly show, once a gender is “assigned,” society expects individuals to act like “females” and “males.” These expectations are fulfilled and reproduced in the practices of everyday life (Bourdieu, 1990; Lorber, 1994).</p>
