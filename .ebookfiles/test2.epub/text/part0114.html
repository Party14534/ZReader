<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Throughout much of human history, the pace of social change was slow; most people followed ways of life similar to those of their forebears. By contrast, todayâ€™s world is subject to dramatic and continuous transformation. In the remaining chapters, we consider some of the major areas of change.</b></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">The growing field known as sociology of the body addresses one of the most far-reaching influences of globalization. <a href="part0115_split_000.html#3DLGM0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 18</a> examines how global processes affect our bodies, including diet, health, disease, and sexual behavior.</b></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">In turn, the globalizing of social life both influences and is influenced by changing patterns of urbanization, which is the subject of <a href="part0121_split_000.html#3JCK20-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 19</a>. This chapter also analyzes the tremendous growth in world population and the increasing threat of environmental problems.</b></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">The concluding chapter explores some of the major processes of social change from the eighteenth century to the present, offers general interpretations of the nature of social change, and considers where global change is likely to lead us in the twenty-first century.</b></p>
