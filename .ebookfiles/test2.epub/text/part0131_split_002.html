<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Is There a Need for Global Governance?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Globalization has brought with it violence, internal conflict, and chaotic transformations in many areas of the world. The existing political structures and models appear unequipped to manage the risks, inequalities, and challenges that transcend national borders. Individual governments cannot control the spread of HIV/AIDS or Zika, counter the effects of global warming, or regulate volatile financial markets. Critics of globalization see global organizations such as transnational corporations or the WTO as responsible. Others see opportunities to harness globalizing forces in the pursuit of greater equality, democracy, and prosperity.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Protesters against the WTO and other international financial institutions argue that exuberance over global economic integration and free trade is forcing people to live in an economy rather than a society. Many are convinced that such moves will further weaken the economic position of poor societies by allowing transnational corporations to operate with few or no safety and environmental regulations. Commercial interests, they claim, are increasingly taking precedence over concern for human well-being. Not only within countries in the global south, but in industrialized ones as well, the call is for greater investment in “human capital” (public health, education, and training) if global divisions are not to deepen. In their view, a key challenge for the twenty-first century is to ensure that globalization works for people everywhere, not only for those who are already well placed to benefit from it.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Walden Bello is a sociologist, member of the Philippine Parliament, and anti-globalization activist. Bello (2005) has called for <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-deglobalization" href="part0131_split_003.html#deglobalization">deglobalization</a>—reducing global interdependence by rendering economies less dependent on trade and global supply chains, instead making them as local as possible. Bello envisions democratically controlled local economies, where greater equality, rather than profit maximization, would be the goal. This goal would be achieved by subjecting key economic decisions to democratic choice rather than the marketplace. Bello’s deglobalized world would boast income redistribution, community cooperatives, small and medium-size businesses, and state enterprises—but no transnational corporations.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Bello regards deglobalization as necessary on ecological as well as moral grounds. He argues that today’s global economy, where products move thousands of miles, is in large part responsible for fossil fuel depletion, pollution, greenhouse gases, and global climate change. As he sees it,</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We must no longer think simply in terms of neutralizing the multilateral agencies that form the outer trenches of the system <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_852" title="852"></span>but of disabling the transnational corporations that are fortresses and the earthworks that constitute the core of the global economic system. I am talking about disabling not just the WTO, the IMF, and the World Bank but the transnational corporation itself. And I am not talking about a process of “reregulating” the TNCs but of eventually disabling or dismantling them as fundamental hazards to people, society, the environment, to everything we hold dear. (Bello, 2005)</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Bello’s views on deglobalization would be regarded as completely wrongheaded by those who argue that global capitalism is not only here to stay, but has resulted in higher living standards for hundreds of millions of people. Even those who share many of his criticisms of globalization would most likely regard his call for deglobalization as utopian. They would argue that the challenge is to make globalization work better for everyone—to establish institutions that would more effectively regulate the global economy, instead of leaving it to the marketplace. The Nobel Prize–winning economist Joseph Stiglitz (2003, 2007, 2010) and the philanthropist George Soros (2000, 2005, 2009) have both called for reforms of the current system, rather than overturning it completely.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">New forms of global governance could help promote a cosmopolitan world order in which transparent rules and standards for international behavior, such as the defense of human rights, are established and observed. Yet the existing institutions of global governance hardly seem up to the task of reform: The UN and its affiliated organizations, such as the International Labor Organization, have little or no enforcement power, while the WTO, as presently constituted, seeks to promote free trade and economic deregulation (although Stiglitz and others have proposed reforms that could make it more responsive to social concerns).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Erik Olin Wright’s 2012 presidential address to the American Sociological Association called for “envisioning real utopias”—nonreformist reforms that would move us incrementally toward a more egalitarian world. In his book <i class="italic">Envisioning Real Utopias</i> (2010), Wright critically evaluates the pros and cons of numerous proposals for reform, as well as specific organizations (such as worker-owned cooperatives or a guaranteed minimal income) that provide concrete examples of what might be possible. This is important, he argues, because</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">most people in the world today, especially in the economically developed regions of the world, no longer believe in this possibility. Capitalism seems to most people part of the natural order of things. . . . This book hopes to contribute to rebuilding a sense of possibility for emancipatory social change by investigating the feasibility of radically different kinds of institutions and social relations that could potentially advance the democratic egalitarian goals historically associated with the idea of socialism. In part this investigation will be empirical, examining cases of institutional innovations that embody in one way or another emancipatory alternatives to the dominant forms of social organization. In part it will be more speculative, exploring theoretical proposals that have not yet been implemented but nevertheless are attentive to realistic problems of institutional design and social feasibility. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_853" title="853"></span>The idea is to provide empirical and theoretical grounding for radical democratic egalitarian visions of an alternative social world. (Wright, 2010)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The move toward global governance and more effective regulatory institutions, and the search for alternatives to the present system, are clearly warranted at a time when global interdependence and the rapid pace of change link all people together more than ever before. Whether such changes should take the form of a move toward less global interdependence, as Bello and the global justice movement envision, or reforming the current system, as Soros, Stiglitz, and Wright call for, is open for discussion and debate.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is not beyond our abilities to reassert our will on the social world. Indeed, such a task appears to be both the greatest necessity and the greatest challenge facing human societies in the twenty-first century.</p>
