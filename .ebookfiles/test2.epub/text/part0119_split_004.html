<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">Is Sexual Orientation Inborn or Learned?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most sociologists believe that sexual orientation—whether LGBTQ, heterosexual, bisexual, or asexual—results from a complex interplay between biological factors and social learning. Since heterosexuality is the norm for most people in U.S. culture, considerable research has focused on why some people are gay. Some scholars argue that biological influences predispose certain people to become gay from birth (Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith, 1981; Green, 1987). Biological explanations have included differences in brain characteristics of gays and lesbians (LeVay, 1996; Maugh and Zamichow, 1991), genetic influences on sexual orientation (Hamer et al., 1993), and the effect on fetal development of the mother’s hormone production during pregnancy (Blanchard and Bogaert, 1996; Manning, Koukourakis, and Brodie, 1997; McFadden and Champlin, 2000). Such studies, which are based on small numbers of cases, give highly inconclusive (and highly controversial) results (Healy, 2001). It is virtually impossible to separate biological factors from early social influences in determining a person’s sexual orientation (LeVay, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Studies of twins may shed light on any genetic basis for sexual orientation since identical twins share identical genes. In two related studies, Bailey and Pillard (1991) examined 167 pairs of brothers and 143 pairs of sisters, with each pair of siblings <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_756" title="756"></span>raised in the same family, in which at least one sibling defined himself or herself as gay. Some of these pairs were identical twins (who share all genes), some were fraternal twins (who share some genes), and some were adoptive brothers or sisters (who share no genes). The researchers reasoned that if sexual orientation is determined entirely by biology, then since in each case at least one of the identical twins identified as gay, all the study’s identical twins, having the identical genetic makeup, should also identify as gay. Among the fraternal twins, some pairs would identify as gay, since some genes are shared. The lowest rates of LGBTQ orientation were predicted for the adoptive brothers and sisters.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The results seem to show that preferences for a same-sex sexual partner, like preferences for an opposite-sex sexual partner, result from a combination of biological and social factors. Among the men and the women studied, in roughly one out of every two identical twin pairs, the second twin also identified as gay, compared with 1 out of every 5 fraternal twins and 1 out of every 10 adoptive brothers and sisters (Bailey and Pillard, 1991; see also Burr, 1993; Maugh, 1991, 1993). In other words, a woman or man is five times as likely to be gay if her or his identical twin is gay than if her or his sibling is gay but related only through adoption. These results offer some support for the importance of biological factors, since the higher the percentage of shared genes, the greater the percentage of cases in which both siblings identified as gay. However, because approximately half of the identical twin brothers and sisters of individuals who identified as gay did not themselves identify as gay, social learning must also be involved; otherwise, one would expect all identical twin siblings of individuals who identify as gay to also identify as gay.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Clearly, even studies of identical twins cannot fully isolate biological from social factors. It is often the case that even in infancy, identical twins are treated more like one another by parents, peers, and teachers than are fraternal twins, who in turn are treated more like one another than are adoptive siblings. Thus, identical twins may have more than genes in common: They may also share a higher proportion of similar socializing experiences.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologist Peter Bearman (2002) has shown the intricate ways that genetics and social experience are intertwined. Bearman found that males with a female twin are twice as likely to report same-sex attractions. He theorized that parents of opposite-sex twins are more likely to give them unisex treatment, leading to a less traditionally masculine influence on the males. Having an older brother decreases the rate of homosexuality. Bearman hypothesized that an older brother establishes gender-socializing mechanisms for the younger brother to follow, which allows him to compensate for unisex treatment. Bearman’s work is consistent with the statements offered by professional organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, which concludes that “sexual orientation probably is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences” (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2004).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Scholarly debates over the “cause” of sexual orientation underscore the very themes that have provided the foundation for this chapter and for the sociological study of the body and sexuality more generally. It is simplistic to think that there is a “single-bullet” explanation for phenomena as complex as health, sexuality, and illness; rather, a complex array of cultural, biological, technological, social, and economic factors play a dynamic and essential role.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The sociology of health, illness, and the body is a fascinating and ever-evolving field. As sociologists look to the new decade, they will learn much more about how and why diseases like COVID-19 spread so quickly, why some populations are especially vulnerable, and the ways that everyday life is affected by the disease’s spread. As new health conditions arise, some will be stigmatized and others will not, and medical sociologists will develop insights, policies, and practices to help people manage their illness and the challenges that accompany it.</p>
