<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Carol Gilligan (1982) further developed Chodorow’s analysis, concentrating on the images adult women and men have of themselves and their attainments. Women, she agrees with Chodorow, define themselves in terms of personal relationships and judge their achievements in terms of their ability to care for others. Women’s place in the lives of men historically has been that of caretaker and helpmate. But the qualities developed in these tasks are devalued by men, who see their own emphasis on individual achievement as the only form of success. Women’s concern with relationships appears to men as a weakness rather than as the strength that in fact it is.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Gilligan carried out intensive interviews with about 200 American women and men of varying ages and social backgrounds. She asked a range of questions concerning their moral outlook and conceptions of self. When asked, “What does it mean to say something is morally right or wrong?” the men mentioned abstract ideals of duty, justice, and individual freedom, whereas the women raised the theme of helping others. The women were more tentative in their moral judgments than the men, seeing possible contradictions between following a strict moral code and avoiding harming others. Gilligan suggests that this outlook reflects the traditional situation of women, anchored in caring relationships, rather than the outward-looking attitudes of men. Women’s views of themselves are based on successfully fulfilling the needs of others, rather than on pride in individual achievement (Gilligan, 1982). Gilligan’s work has been widely critiqued by feminist scholars, however, on the grounds that it essentializes gender differences and reifies the (mis)perception that women are innate caregivers (Senchuk, 1990). If indeed women abide by an ethic of care, it is likely a function of societal expectations rather than inherent differences in men’s and women’s morality. Gender roles are socially constructed and evolve over time, so theories that emphasize innate differences between men and women or boys and girls may not be sufficient to characterize our ever-changing world.</p>
