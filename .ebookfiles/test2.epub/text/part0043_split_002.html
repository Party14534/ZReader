<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Are our music choices a matter of personal taste or an example of conforming behavior? We tend to think of the music we listen to as an intensely personal choice made independently of the people around us and one that reflects our individual personalities and preferences. How much, however, do our group memberships and social networks shape our most personal of decisions, such as our aesthetic tastes?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Social scientists Matthew Salganik, Peter Dodds, and Duncan Watts (2006) conducted research to test the effects of the influence of social networks on musical choices. To do so, they created an artificial cultural market on a website named Music Lab. More than 14,000 participants registered with the site and were asked to listen to music by bands with which they were unfamiliar and then rate how much they liked the songs. If they liked the music, they could download songs. The researchers first divided their sample into two groups. Those in the control group were unable to use the website to see what other participants were listening to. Members of the experimental, or “treatment,” group, or the “social influence” group, were able to see what other participants on the site were listening to as well as downloading. The social influence group was further placed <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_186" title="186"></span>into eight “worlds,” and participants could see only the rankings and number of downloads of people in their world.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The researchers found that in the social influence groups, the most popular songs were more popular than those in the control group—that is, when participants knew what songs were favored by others, they were more likely to favor those songs themselves. The most popular song in each world was also different, providing further evidence of the importance of group influence. This suggests that the determinants of popularity in music were based on the listener’s social “world.” That is, the “intrinsic” quality of the music mattered less than the number of people in each world who were listening to the song, giving it high ratings, and downloading it.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The authors of the study described the effect of social networks as a “cumulative advantage” where “if one object happens to be slightly more popular than another at just the right point, it will tend to become more popular still. As a result, even tiny, random fluctuations can blow up, generating potentially enormous long-run differences among even indistinguishable competitors—a phenomenon that is similar in some ways to the famous ‘butterfly effect’ in chaos theory” (Watts, 2007). The butterfly effect proposes that small variations may produce large variations in the long-term behavior of a system or organism. Salganik, Dodds, and Watts’s study revealed the impact of our social networks, which are now increasingly virtual networks, on our music decisions.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Studying how consumers make decisions is a part of a much deeper sociological tradition that is concerned with conformity, propaganda, and the question of how leaders have persuaded whole populations to take part in horrific deeds. The Holocaust, which claimed the lives of more than 6 million Jews and millions of others, left many social scientists searching to understand how, why, and under what conditions ordinary people would conform to authority. Many students who have seen or read about Stanley Milgram’s laboratory experiments or the “make-believe jail” experiment (discussed in <a href="part0015_split_000.html#E9OE0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 2</a>) tend to think that they would not conform to the demands of an authority figure as the study participants did. Yet the Music Lab study reveals how social environments affect our behavior and how we all, at times, conform to the movements of larger social groups, even when it comes to something as personal as the music we like.</p>
