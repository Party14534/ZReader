<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">A Brief History of Urbanization</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">At the beginning of the twentieth century, fewer than one out of every seven people on the planet lived in cities. In 2018, more than half of the world’s population (55 percent) lived in cities (World Bank, 2019l); by mid-century, more than two-thirds may be urban, with 90 percent of the increase taking place in Asia and Africa (UNDESA, 2018a). As population growth continues and globalization results in the spread of manufacturing throughout the world, we can expect the growth of cities, many of them gigantic in size, to continue.</p>
<section id="premodern-cities">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Premodern Cities</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In premodern times, cities were self-contained entities that stood apart from the predominantly rural areas in which they were located. Road systems sometimes linked major urban areas, but travel was a specialized affair for merchants, soldiers, and others who needed to cross distances with some regularity. Communication among cities was limited.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The world’s first cities appeared at around 3500 <small class="smallcaps">B.C.E</small>., in the river valleys of the Nile in Egypt, the Tigris and Euphrates in what is now Iraq, and the Indus in what is today Pakistan. Cities in traditional societies were very small by modern standards. Babylon, for example, one of the largest ancient Near Eastern cities, extended over an area of only 3.2 square miles and, at its height, around 2000 <small class="smallcaps">B.C.E</small>., probably numbered no more than 15,000 to 20,000 people. Rome under Emperor Augustus in the first century <small class="smallcaps">B.C.E</small>. was easily the largest premodern city outside China, with some 300,000 inhabitants—the population of Stockton, California, or Cincinnati, Ohio, today. Most cities of the ancient world shared certain features. They were surrounded by walls for the purposes of military defense. Their centers, often protected by a second inner wall, typically featured a religious temple, royal palace, government buildings, a public square, and a market (Fox, 1964; Sjoberg, 1960, 1963; Wheatley, 1971). The dwellings of the ruling class or elite tended to be concentrated in or near the center, while less-privileged groups lived closer to the city walls or sometimes outside them, moving inside if the city came under attack. Different ethnic and religious communities were often segregated in separate neighborhoods, where their members lived and worked; sometimes even these neighborhoods were walled. Lacking any form of mass printing, public officials had to shout at the tops of their voices to deliver pronouncements. “Streets” were usually strips of land on which no one had yet built. A few traditional civilizations boasted sophisticated road systems linking particular cities, but these existed mainly for military purposes, and transportation for the most part was slow and limited. Merchants and soldiers were the only people who regularly traveled over long distances. Sanitary conditions were rudimentary at best, with open sewers and animal excrement likely to be everywhere.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although cities became the main centers for science, the arts, and cosmopolitan culture, their influence over the rest of the country was always weak. No more than a tiny proportion of the population lived in the cities, and the division between cities and the countryside was pronounced. By far the majority of people lived in small rural communities and rarely came into contact with more than the occasional state official or merchant from the towns.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">The Rise of the Megalopolis</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Britain was the first society to undergo industrialization, beginning in the mid-eighteenth century. The process of industrialization generated increasing urbanization. In 1800, less than 20 percent of the British population lived in towns or cities with more than 10,000 inhabitants. By 1900, this proportion had risen to 74 percent. London held about 1.1 million people in 1800; by the beginning of the twentieth century, it had increased in size to a population of more than 7 million, at that date the largest city ever seen in the world. It was a vast manufacturing, commercial, and financial center at the heart of the still-expanding British Empire.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The urbanization of most other European countries and the United States took place somewhat later. When the American colonies declared independence in 1776, the largest city was Philadelphia, with a population of only 40,000. By 1800, the United States was more of a rural society than were the leading European countries; fewer than 10 percent of Americans lived in communities with populations of more than 2,500 people. Between 1800 and 1900, as industrialization grew in the United States, the population of New York City leapt from 60,000 people to 4.8 million. It is currently the largest city in the United States at 8.6 million.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The contrast in size between the largest modern cities today and those of premodern civilizations is extraordinary. The most populous cities in the industrialized countries—sometimes termed “megacities”—number more than 10 million inhabitants. A <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-conurbation" href="part0124_split_006.html#conurbation">conurbation</a>—a cluster of cities and towns forming a continuous network—may include even larger numbers of people. The peak of urban life today is represented by what is called the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-megalopolis" href="part0124_split_006.html#megalopolis">megalopolis</a>, the “city of cities.” The term was first used in modern times to refer to the Northeast Corridor of the United States, an area covering some 450 miles from north of Boston to south of Washington, D.C. In this region, some 56 million people live at a density of more than 800 persons per square mile. Large, dense urban populations can also be found in the lower Great Lakes region surrounding Chicago.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Manuel Castells (1996) refers to <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-megacities" href="part0124_split_006.html#megacities">megacities</a> as one of the main features of third-millennium urbanization. They are global cities, functioning as population magnets for the countries or regions in which they are located. People are drawn to large urban areas for various reasons, including somehow benefitting from their global role, and there is evidence that at least some succeed: Average urban incomes are higher than those in rural areas, and there is usually better access to public services such as education, health, transportation, communication, water supply, and sanitation. Because of economies of scale, cities are better equipped to provide such services efficiently and cheaply to large, concentrated populations (UNDP, 2007). Yet at the same time, densely populated urban areas have proven to be fertile grounds for the spread of disease, as the deadly COVID-19 pandemic revealed: by the end of May 2020, of the approximately 100,000 known COVID-related deaths that had occurred in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_781" title="781"></span>entire United States, over a quarter of which (20,000) were in New York City (CDC COVID-19 Response Team, 2020b).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although there are exceptions, urbanization generally goes hand in hand with economic growth. The least urbanized countries are also low-income countries (where only 33 percent live in urban areas); next come the more urbanized middle-income countries (with 53 percent urban); high-income countries are the most urbanized (81 percent). With the exception of some small island nations (such as Gibraltar or Bermuda) and city-states (such as Monaco or Singapore), the most urbanized countries are Belgium (98 percent); Uruguay (95 percent); and Israel, Argentina, and Japan (92 percent). The United States, 82 percent urban, is somewhat more urbanized than the European Union (76 percent). The least urbanized countries are those in South Asia (34 percent), which is also one of the poorest regions in the world (World Bank, 2019l).</p>
