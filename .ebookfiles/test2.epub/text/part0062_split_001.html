<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">People in high-income countries are far healthier than their counterparts in low-income countries. Low-income countries generally suffer from inadequate health facilities, and the few hospitals or clinics seldom serve the poorest people. Residents of low-income countries also lack proper sanitation, drink polluted water, and risk contracting infectious diseases. They are more likely to suffer malnourishment, starvation, and famine (World Bank, 2019d). All of these factors contribute to physical weakness and poor health. Poor countries also often become dumping grounds for discarded consumer electronics and other toxic waste from high-income countries, and suffer environmental pollution from the factories that are manufacturing goods for high-income country corporations and consumers (see <a href="part0121_split_000.html#3JCK20-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 19</a> for further discussion).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because of such poor health conditions, people in low-income countries are more likely to die in infancy and less likely to live to old age than people in high-income countries. Children in low-income countries are 26 times more likely to die before they reach the age of five than children in high-income countries. Children often die of illnesses that are readily treated in wealthier countries, such as measles or diarrhea. People in low-income countries have an average life expectancy of 63 years, compared to 81 years in high-income countries. Still, conditions are improving somewhat. Over the 20-year period from 1998–2018, the child mortality rate dropped by nearly half, from 94 (per 1,000 live births) to 48 in low-income countries (World Bank, 2019m). In addition, over the same period average life expectancy at birth increased from 53 to 63 as a result of the wider availability of modern medical technology, improved sanitation, and rising incomes.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One interesting caveat is that in the United States and other countries, illnesses that had been all but eradicated are starting to resurface, due in large part to the fact that many parents are electing not to immunize their children over fears of a link between immunization and autism—a fear most scientific researchers believe is unfounded. Immunization rates in the United States have declined slightly in recent years, and outbreaks of whooping cough and measles in other countries are believed to have resulted from people who refused vaccines (Hviid et al., 2019; DeStefano and Shimabukuro, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_307" title="307"></span>2019; NIH, 2019). This is especially of concern in a highly globalized world, where people with communicable illnesses can easily cross borders. Over the past decade, a number of measles outbreaks have spread throughout Western Europe among unvaccinated populations (World Health Organization, 2019b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One chilling example of the relationship between global poverty and disease is the Ebola epidemic that broke out in West Africa in 2014. Ebola—also called haemorrhagic fever because one of its symptoms is internal and external bleeding—is a deadly disease that is spread through contact with the blood or bodily fluids of infected persons who are showing symptoms. Because transmission requires direct physical contact, treatment requires that patients be isolated, and caregivers wear protective suits that cover their entire bodies. When Ebola victims are not completely quarantined, the disease can spread exponentially: One infected person can infect all who come in close bodily contact (such as family members who are unaware of the seriousness of the disease), and they, in turn, can infect everyone with whom they have physical contact. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2016b), this was the largest outbreak of Ebola in history; two of five people who contracted the disease died. By the end of 2016, two years after Ebola first broke out in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, nearly 29,000 cases had been reported in those countries and more than 11,000 people had died. The illness spread rapidly partly because it was new to this region of Africa and therefore went unrecognized. Caregivers, from family members to professional health workers, initially believed it to be malaria or some other disease transmitted by mosquitoes rather than human contact. It is worth noting that in another poor African country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the disease was quickly recognized because it had broken out several times before; health care workers moved quickly to contain it, with the result that only 50 people died. Ebola also spread rapidly in West Africa because there were no health care facilities capable of dealing with the large and growing number of Ebola patients, facilities that required patients to be completely isolated and treated by trained medical personnel wearing special (and costly) protective suits.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many victims were in remote rural areas that lacked usable roads or other infrastructure, making it difficult to identify, isolate, and treat them; when they flooded into crowded cities in search of treatment, the disease quickly spread. The borders between Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, drawn by colonial powers in the nineteenth century, are in many places open. Today, people freely cross them, making containment of the disease difficult. And years of war and corrupt governments in this region meant that a concerted state-led response was unlikely (Fox, 2014). As a result, during the first months of the outbreak, as many as three-quarters of infected victims died. When Ebola is diagnosed early and treated adequately, even in impoverished areas of West Africa, some two-thirds survive (National Public Radio, 2014). Of the first 10 Ebola patients treated in the United States, most of whom were health care workers who had contracted the disease while treating patients in West Africa, eight recovered—an 80 percent recovery rate reflects what can be accomplished with modern health care facilities (<i class="italic">New York Times</i>, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When the deadly coronavirus broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of December 2019, Chinese officials quarantined the city of 11 million people, imposed severe travel restrictions within China, and cooperated with the World Health Organization to stem its spread elsewhere. Yet at the same time, while the Ebola epidemic <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_308" title="308"></span>was largely isolated within remote African villages, the coronavirus was far more readily spread to other countries: Wuhan is a cosmopolitan Chinese center of industry and commerce, and by the time the disease was identified and restrictive measures were put in place, unknowingly infected persons had traveled elsewhere in China as well as to other countries. As of August 2020, only eight months after the disease was first identified, the World Health Organization reported that the disease had spread to nearly every country in the world, resulting in nearly 126 million confirmed cases and 640,000 deaths—both numbers rapidly increasing. The United States alone, by September 2020, had accounted for over 6 million confirmed cases and 200,000 deaths (WHO, 2020e). The coronavirus also shuttered businesses around the world, as concerns over widespread contagion and massive numbers of deaths led many countries to adopt strict measures limiting or even prohibiting most retail activities. This, in turn, disrupted global supply chains, as factories around the world—themselves often sites of the pandemic—lost their customers. The result of today’s highly interconnected world was therefore not only the global spread of a deadly disease, but the deepest global recession since World War II (World Bank, 2020a).</p>
