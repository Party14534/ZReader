<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The National Research Council (NRC) report <i class="italic">Elder Mistreatment: Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation</i> (Bonnie and Wallace, 2003) defines elder abuse as “(a) intentional actions that cause harm or create a serious risk of harm, whether or not intended, to a vulnerable elder by a caregiver or other person who stands in a trust relationship to the elder, or (b) failure by a caregiver to satisfy the elder’s basic needs or to protect the elder from harm.” Mistreatment may take many forms, including physical, sexual, emotional, or financial abuse, neglect, or abandonment.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Elder mistreatment is very difficult to measure and document. Older adults who are embarrassed, ashamed, or fearful of retaliation by their abusers may be reluctant to report such experiences. As a result, official prevalence rates are low. Worldwide, it is estimated that 15.7 percent of persons age 65+ experience some form of abuse in community setting (Yon et al., 2017; WHO, 2018). In the United States, the prevalence of elder abuse is estimated to be about 10 percent (Lachs and Pillemer, 2015). The most recent study of elder abuse, of more than 4,000 older adults in New York, found that 7.6 percent of participants had experienced some form of abuse in the last year (Burnes et al., 2015). A national survey (2008) found that 9 percent of older adults reported verbal mistreatment, 3.5 percent reported financial mistreatment, and less than 1 percent reported physical mistreatment by a family member. Women and persons with physical disabilities were most likely to report abuse. Elder abuse is likely grossly underreported: One study found that only about 7 percent of cases of elder abuse are reported to authorities (National Center on Elder Abuse, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is widely believed that abuse results from the anger and resentment that adult children feel when confronted with the need to care for their infirm parents (King, 1984; Steinmetz, 1983). Most studies, however, have found this assumption to be false. In the aforementioned national survey, most mistreatment was perpetrated by someone other than a member of the elder’s immediate family. Of those who reported verbal mistreatment, 26 percent named their spouse or romantic partner as the perpetrator, 15 percent named their child, and 57 percent named someone other than a spouse, parent, or child. Similarly, 56 percent of elders who reported financial mistreatment said that someone other than a family member was responsible; of family members, though, children were mentioned most often, while spouses were rarely named (Laumann, Leitsch, and Waite, 2008).</p>
