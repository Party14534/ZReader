<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Contemporary Research on Sexual Behavior over the Life Course</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Scholars who document patterns of health, illness, and sexuality in the current day owe a debt of gratitude to Alfred Kinsey; in the 1950s, his research was pioneering in that it was among the first truly scientific studies of adult sexuality. Despite its methodological flaws, the work was path-breaking because it revealed the vast diversity in U.S. adults’ sexual preferences. Since that time, public interest in, and research on, sexuality have flourished. Part of this research and interest was driven by the cultural zeitgeist at the time. In the 1960s, social movements that challenged the existing order, such as those associated with countercultural lifestyles, broke with existing sexual norms. These movements preached sexual freedom, and the introduction of the contraceptive pill allowed sexual pleasure to be separated from reproduction. Women’s groups also started pressing for greater independence from male sexual values, rejection of the double standard, and the need for women to achieve greater sexual satisfaction in their relationships. Until relatively recently, it was unclear to what extent sexual behavior had changed since the time of Kinsey’s research.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the late 1980s, Lillian Rubin (1990) interviewed 1,000 Americans between the ages of 13 and 48 to identify changes in sexual behavior and attitudes over the previous 30 years or so. Her findings indicated significant changes. Sexual activity begins at a younger age; moreover, teenagers’ sexual practices are as varied and comprehensive as those of adults. There is still a double standard, but it is not as powerful as before. Contemporary scholarship confirms this finding. Studies of high school–age students find that sexual permissiveness is much greater today than it was in the 1970s. According to the CDC (2016a; Abma and Martinez, 2017), a study conducted between 2011 and 2015 found that about 42 percent of all high school students reported having sexual intercourse by age 18, and 12 percent reported having had four or more partners. Both figures represent declines from 1991, when more than 54 percent of high school students had had sex and nearly 19 percent had had four or more partners. Still, U.S. rates are far higher than those in Japan and China (Tang and Zuo, 2000; Toufexis, 1993).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Recent research on the sexual lives of college students shows that a “hookup” culture dominates college campuses, where both male and female students will have one-night stands, short-lived sexual relationships, or “friends with benefits” relationships where friends will occasionally have sexual relations, without the expectation that their friendship will transform into a full-blown romance (Wade, 2017; Garcia et al., 2012; Hamilton and Armstrong, 2009). However, when a team of sociologists delved <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_741" title="741"></span>more closely into the sexual lives of college students, they found that while casual sexual encounters were relatively common, men and women were fairly selective in such encounters.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologist Paula England and colleagues interviewed more than 14,000 undergraduate students at 19 universities and colleges about their romantic and sexual lives. Nearly three-quarters (72 percent) of both women and men said that they had at least one “hookup” during their senior year. But, for most, hookups were relatively rare. Of those students who said that they ever “hooked up,” equal proportions said that they had fewer than three (40 percent) or between four and nine (40 percent) hookups. Just one in five reported 10 or more hookups in their lifetimes. Moreover, not all of these hookups involved sexual intercourse. When asked about their most recent hookup, roughly one-third each said they had participated in sexual intercourse, oral or manual stimulation of the genitals, or kissing and touching. And while TV shows and movies would lead us to believe that all college students are having sex, England and her collaborators found that fully 20 percent of college seniors had never had sexual intercourse (England, Shafer, and Fogarty, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Studies of the sexual lives of adults beyond college age also reveal that Americans report relatively few sexual partners and less frequent sex than their counterparts in other nations. For example, in 1994, a team of researchers led by Edward Laumann published <i class="italic">The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States</i>, the most comprehensive study of sexual behavior since Kinsey. Their findings reflect an essential sexual conservatism among Americans. For instance, 83 percent of their subjects had had only one partner (or no partner at all) in the preceding year, and among married people, the figure was fully 96 percent, suggesting that only a tiny share of married people have been unfaithful to their spouse in the past year. Fidelity to one’s spouse was also quite common: Only 10 percent of women and less than 25 percent of men reported having an extramarital affair during their lifetime. According to the study, Americans average only three partners during their entire lifetime. Despite the apparent ordinariness of sexual behavior, some distinct historical changes were revealed in this study, the most significant being a progressive increase in the level of premarital sexual experience, particularly among women.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although documenting and monitoring the sexual behavior of young people remains a widespread concern even in the twenty-first century, researchers are increasingly documenting sexual activity among older persons (Karraker, Delamater, and Schwartz, 2011). Older persons, once considered either uninterested in, or physically incapable of having satisfying sexual relations, reveal high levels of both sexual activity and satisfaction. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a study of sexuality among American women and men ages 57 to 85, reports that most married older persons have had sex in the last year. Although sexual problems do arise, they were reported by a minority of respondents. Women tended to report more sexual problems than men; commonly reported problems included lack of sexual interest, inability to climax, pain, and lack of pleasure during intercourse. Among men, by contrast, sexual problems included climaxing too early and performance anxiety (Lindau et al., 2007). However, older adults may adjust their sexual practices so that they can accommodate their physical declines, often substituting touching and other forms of closeness for sexual intercourse (Ginsberg, Pomerantz, and Kramer-Feeley, 2005).</p>

<section id="methodological-advances-in-studying-sexual-behavior-in-the-united-states">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Methodological Advances in Studying Sexual Behavior in the United States</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists frequently use survey questionnaires to gain information on human behavior. However, obtaining detailed information on sexual behavior and attitudes is difficult. The two most comprehensive studies of sexuality in the United States—the Kinsey studies (1948, 1953) and the Laumann study (1994)—offer very different portraits of sexual preferences and behaviors. Do these conflicting results reflect historical changes in sexual mores, or are the differences an outcome of methodological approaches?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In stark contrast to Kinsey’s results, which found that a high proportion of men had premarital or extramarital sex, in the Laumann study, 83 percent of survey respondents said they had had only one or no sexual partners in the year prior to the study. Moreover, only 10 percent of women and less than 25 percent of men reported ever having had an extramarital affair. It’s possible that Americans have become more sexually conservative—perhaps from fear of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">An alternative explanation for the discrepant findings is the researchers’ different methodological approaches. Kinsey, an evolutionary biologist, first gave a questionnaire about sexual practices to students in his zoology classes. Finding this method unsatisfactory, he next conducted face-to-face interviews and then focused on specific social groups. He and his colleagues eventually interviewed nearly 18,000 people. Kinsey recognized that the ideal survey would be random, and that the results would, therefore, represent the general population. However, he did not believe it was possible to persuade a randomly selected group of Americans to answer deeply personal questions about their sexual behavior. Consequently, his survey respondents were primarily college students living in sorority and fraternity houses, prisoners, psychiatric patients, and friends. To make his data more credible, Kinsey made every effort to interview 100 percent of the members of each group, such as all students living in a given fraternity house. Because Kinsey’s data are based on a convenience sample, they are not representative of the American public. Moreover, many of his survey respondents volunteered to participate in the study. Thus, they may have been different from nonvolunteers in having wider sexual experiences or a greater interest in sexuality. Further, many of his study questions asked about “lifetime” behavior or whether one had ever engaged in a particular practice; such a question will necessarily yield a greater number of positive responses than a question that focuses on a limited time frame, such as the past 12 months.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Laumann study, in contrast, is based on data from the National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS). The NHSLS data were obtained from a nationally representative random sample of more than 3,000 American men and women between the ages of 18 and 59 who spoke English. In addition, Laumann’s team purposely oversampled among Blacks and Hispanics so that they would have enough members of these minority groups to analyze their survey responses separately with confidence that findings were statistically reliable and valid. Recognizing that people are often hesitant to discuss sexuality, Laumann’s team paid particular attention to choosing nonjudgmental language in their questionnaire. The team also built several “checks” into their questionnaire to ensure the veracity of responses. Several questions were redundant but were asked in different ways throughout the interview to gauge whether respondents were answering truthfully. The team also included 11 questions that had <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_743" title="743"></span>been asked previously on another national random sample survey of Americans. Comparisons of responses to the two sets of questions provided Laumann’s researchers with assurance that their results were consistent with others’ findings.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although the Kinsey and Laumann studies are influential works on human sexuality, they also demonstrate that the process through which sociological knowledge is obtained can be as important as the actual research findings.</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The research we have reviewed so far reveals that Americans’ attitudes toward human sexuality have grown increasingly expansive and open-minded throughout much of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Yet does this open-mindedness extend to all groups? Some contend that anti-gay prejudice persists, and that gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Americans still do not enjoy the same rights and privileges as their heterosexual and cisgender peers. The greater status, prestige, and benefits afforded to heterosexual people is called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-heterosexism" href="part0118_split_005.html#heterosexism">heterosexism</a>. It is closely related to the concept of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-homophobia" href="part0118_split_005.html#homophobia">homophobia</a>, a term coined in the late 1960s that refers to attitudes and behaviors marked by an aversion to, or hatred of, LGBTQ persons and their practices. It is a form of prejudice reflected not only in overt acts of hostility and violence toward lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons but also in forms of verbal abuse that are widespread in American culture; for example, using words such as <i class="italic">fag</i> or <i class="italic">homo</i> to insult heterosexual males or using female-related offensive terms such as <i class="italic">sissy</i> or <i class="italic">pansy</i> to insult gay men (Pascoe, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A 2017 survey found that in the United States, 33 percent of students who self-identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual have been bullied on school property. Another 27 percent experienced cyberbullying. Comparatively, heterosexual peers experienced 17.1 percent and 13.3 percent, respectively (Kann <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_744" title="744"></span>et al., 2018). Another national study from 2015 of more than 10,500 LGBT students between the ages of 13 and 21 found that 85 percent reported that they had been verbally harassed at school, 27 percent were physically harassed, and 49 percent had been victims of cyberbullying. Fully 58 percent felt “unsafe” at school (Kosciw et al., 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although some may discount teasing as harmless, this is a faulty assumption. LGBTQ youth have much higher rates of suicide, suicidal thoughts, depression, and substance use than straight youth, due in large part to the victimization and teasing they suffer at the hands of their classmates and to the failure, at times, of their families and teachers to protect them (Espelage, Aragon, and Birkett, 2008; Ryan et al., 2009; Russell and Joyner, 2001).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sexual prejudice is widespread in U.S. culture, although it is slowly starting to erode. It was only in the recent past (2003) that the Supreme Court ruled in <i class="italic">Lawrence v. Texas</i> that the state of Texas’s prohibition on same-sex sexual relations was a violation of the constitutional right to privacy; in many states, same-sex relations was still a legally punishable crime. Same-sex couples couldn’t marry nationwide until 2015, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality in <i class="italic">Obergefell v. Hodges</i>. Public figures who use homophobic language are publicly upbraided. In 2011, for the first time in its history, the Gallup Poll found that the majority of Americans (53 percent) supported gay marriage (Newport, 2011). In 2019, 61 percent of the population reported supporting gay marriage (Pew Research Center, 2019a).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">The Movement for LGBTQ Civil Rights</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Until recently, most gay, lesbian, and queer persons hid their sexual orientation for fear that “coming out of the closet”—publicly revealing one’s sexual orientation—would cost them their jobs, families, and friends, and leave them open to verbal and physical abuse. Yet, since the late 1960s, many LGBTQ persons have acknowledged their sexual orientation openly, and, in some cities, the lives of lesbian and gay Americans have become quite normalized (Saguy, 2020). Celebrities—ranging from pop singers Halsey and Adam Lambert to news anchor Anderson Cooper—are “out” publicly, with little fanfare. Major league sports, long considered a bastion of heterosexism, embraced Jason Collins, who came out as gay before he played his last season for the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets. With his announcement, Collins became the first active player in one of the four major American professional team sports to announce that he was gay (ESPN, 2013). In 2014, Michael Sam attracted national attention as the first openly gay member of the NFL, although he was cut from the Dallas Cowboys during his first year of play (Belson, 2014). New York City, San Francisco, London, and other large metropolitan areas worldwide have thriving gay and lesbian communities. Coming out may be important not only for the person who does so but also for others in the larger society: Previously closeted lesbians and gays discover they are not alone, while heterosexuals recognize that people whom they admire and respect are gay.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The current global wave of gay and lesbian civil rights movements began partly as an outgrowth of the social movements of the 1960s, which emphasized pride in racial and ethnic identity. One pivotal event was the Stonewall riots in June 1969, when New York City’s gay community, angered by continual police harassment, fought the New York Police Department for two days (D’Emilio, 1983; Weeks, 1977). The Stonewall riots became a symbol of gay pride. In 1994, on the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_745" title="745"></span>riots, 100,000 people attended the International March on the United Nations to Affirm the Human Rights of Lesbian and Gay People. In May 2005, the International Day against Homophobia (IDAHO) was first celebrated, with events held in more than 40 countries. Clearly, significant strides have been made, although discrimination and homophobia remain serious problems for many LGBT Americans.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Today, there is a growing movement worldwide for the civil rights of gays and lesbians. The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (2020), which was founded in 1978, has more than 1,600 member organizations in some 150 countries and territories. It holds international conferences, supports lesbian and gay social movement organizations, and lobbies international organizations. For example, it persuaded the Council of Europe to require all its member nations to repeal laws banning same-sex relations. In general, active lesbian and gay social movements thrive in countries that emphasize individual rights and liberal state policies (Frank and McEneaney, 1999).</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet many other nations still ban same-sex relations. In Africa, gay male sex acts have been legalized in only a handful of countries, whereas lesbian relations are seldom mentioned in the law at all. In South Africa, the official policy of the former White government was to regard homosexuality as a psychiatric problem that threatened national security. Once the Black government took power, however, it legislated full equality. In Asia and the Middle East, male same-sex relations are banned in most countries, including all those that are predominantly Islamic. For example, as recently as 2012, four Iranian men were found guilty of sodomy and were sentenced to death. Taiwan is considered among the most liberal nations in Asia, yet it legalized same-sex marriages only as recently as 2019. In contrast, Europe has some of the most liberal laws in the world: Same-sex relations has been legalized in nearly all countries, and many European nations legally recognize same-sex marriages. As of 2020, 30 out of 194 countries for which data are available allow same-sex couples to marry: Northern Ireland (2019), Ecuador (2019), Taiwan (2019), Austria (2019), Australia (2017), the Netherlands (2000), Belgium (2003), Canada (2005), Spain (2005), South Africa (2006), Norway (2009), Sweden (2009), Argentina (2010), Iceland (2010), Portugal (2010), Denmark (2012), Brazil (2013), France (2013), New Zealand (2013), Uruguay (2013), England and Wales (2013), Luxembourg (2014), Scotland (2014), Finland (2015), Greenland (2015), Ireland (2015), the United States (2015), Colombia (2016), Germany <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_746" title="746"></span>(2017), and Malta (2017). Same-sex couples are allowed to wed in parts of Mexico (Pew Research Center, 2019g). (See <a href="part0096_split_000.html#2RHM00-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 15</a> for further information on the legalization of gay marriage.)</p>

<hr class="calibre2"/>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Social change is occurring, slowly but steadily, even in countries that historically have had cruel and oppressive policies toward gays and lesbians. For example, in 2014, the Constitutional Court in Uganda invalidated a previously passed “anti-gay” bill, which allowed for jail terms up to life for persons convicted of having gay sex, and stipulated lengthy jail terms for persons convicted of “attempted homosexuality” or the “promotion of homosexuality” (Gettleman, 2014). This marked a significant change in a nation where, just three years earlier, the outspoken gay rights activist David Kato was beaten to death with a hammer.</p>
