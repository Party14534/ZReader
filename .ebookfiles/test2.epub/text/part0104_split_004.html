<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">Pierre Bourdieu and Cultural Capital</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another seminal figure who wrote about education and reproduction is French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, who argued that schools reproduce social-class inequality by rewarding certain cultural norms over others (1984, 1988). Bourdieu’s focus on the role of culture in the process of reproduction distinguished his theory from a strict Marxist analysis that focused on how schools mirrored and reproduced economic-class structures. For this reason, he used the term <i class="italic">cultural reproduction.</i> In relation to his theory of cultural reproduction, Bourdieu argued that people could possess many kinds of capital other than financial capital. Specifically, he was concerned with the existence of what he called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-cultural-capital" href="part0104_split_005.html#cultural-capital">cultural capital</a>. That is, his theory of cultural reproduction proposes that middle- and upper-class children come to schools with a certain kind of cultural capital—speech patterns, demeanors, tastes, and so on—that the school values, and thus rewards. Bourdieu argues that children from low-income or working-class homes do not possess these same cultural characteristics and thus are placed at a disadvantage in schools.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Another important concept Bourdieu offers is the notion of habitus, which refers to a class-based set of dispositions, such as taste, language use, and demeanor. For Bourdieu, these dispositions are internalized unconsciously through social practices within one’s social group. Put simply, poor and working-class children are socialized into a particular habitus—one that is not valued within the school system. In arguing that working-class individuals are unconsciously socialized into a working-class culture (and therefore are not likely to obtain the dispositions required for school success), Bourdieu, like Bowles and Gintis, ultimately proposes a theory of reproduction in which the cycle of domination seems unbreakable.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These kinds of theories have been challenged by the notion of schools as contested spaces (Aronowitz and Giroux, 1985; Willis, 1977). It has been proposed that social reproduction does not happen without struggle or opposition from oppressed groups. Written over 40 years ago but still important today, Paul Willis’s influential ethnographic study of working-class British youth known as “the lads” shows how working-class students exhibit an implicit understanding that schooling is not structured to benefit their group (industrial factory workers) as a whole. The lads express their understanding that schooling is not designed to better their own conditions as members of the working class by embracing a working-class culture that valorizes manual labor and a counter-school culture. In doing so, they participate in the reproduction of <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_622" title="622"></span>their own class subordination. Willis suggests that these insights demonstrate that working-class youth are not passive dupes in the process of reproduction. Willis also suggests that the emphasis on the lads being in control of their destiny points to possibilities for organized resistance. A number of subsequent studies of resistance in schooling in the United States (Foley, 1994; McLaren, 1985; McLeod, 1995; Solomon, 1992; Valenzuela, 1999) have expanded our understanding of schools as contested spaces.</p>
