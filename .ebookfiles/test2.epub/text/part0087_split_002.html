<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Did the Internet Shape the Outcome of the 2016 Presidential Election?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Internet is a potentially democratizing force, although it can also have the opposite effect—for example, when governments control what is acceptable on the Internet, or when extremists use their websites to mobilize support for acts of violence. The Internet fosters social networking: It allows like-minded people to find one another in cyberspace. While this may contribute to increased dialogue and debate on political issues, it can also create an “echo chamber” in which people seek out only information that confirms, and therefore reinforces, their existing beliefs or prejudices. In the 2016 election, the Internet also provided a way for groups and candidates to appeal directly to voters—and for foreign governments to play a role as well.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we have previously noted, the 2016 election witnessed an unprecedented—and highly effective—use of the Internet. We also noted that Trump’s use of social media, particularly Twitter, was far more effective than Clinton’s. Not only did Trump have far more followers than Clinton, but his tweets were retweeted far more frequently and, importantly, were much more likely to be discussed in the mainstream news, providing a layer of free media coverage estimated to be worth as much as $4 billion. According to some estimates, half the Trump campaign media budget went to digital media, which included a Facebook Live broadcast of the third presidential debate. The campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, a big data firm that had worked on the Brexit campaign, which used massive amounts of data (derived from social media and other sources) to psychologically target 13.5 million voters in six battleground states that it believed could be won over (Persily, 2017). The Trump campaign, as well as the candidate himself, was acutely aware that in order for tweets or any social media to go viral, they had to be provocative, even outrageous. Trump’s tweets famously created “twitterstorms” that energized his base, outraged his opponents, and assured widespread television and newspaper coverage.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The 2016 election also saw the appearance of truly “fake news”—made-up news stories treated as authentic that originated from extremist groups and websites. In perhaps the most frightening example, one right-wing conspiracy theory claimed that a Washington, D.C., pizza shop, Comet Ping Pong, was actually the headquarters of a child sex-trafficking and pornography ring run by Hillary Clinton and John Podesta, her campaign manager. When Alex Jones, the host of the far-right website Infowars, publicized this claim, it made the rounds of the alt-right; one person followed up by firing a shot into the restaurant. Although no one was hurt—and Jones later removed his post and apologized—this event (dubbed “Pizzagate” by the mainstream media) showed how even demonstrably false claims can have potentially disastrous consequences when the Internet permits them to reach millions of people (Shelbourne, 2017; Miller, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Such “fake news” was also deliberately created by foreign and domestic individuals and organizations in an effort to discredit Clinton. Teenagers in Macedonia, realizing that they could make money by publishing anti-Clinton stories that were sufficiently outrageous to attract large numbers of viewers (some of whom would click on the banner ads that would appear), posted made-up stories on some 140 websites. Such stories <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_498" title="498"></span>claimed (among other things) that Tom Hanks and Pope Francis had endorsed Trump, or that an FBI agent who had leaked Clinton’s emails had been killed. Such fake news generated more engagement than mainstream news toward the close of the election. Some of these stories were retweeted by the Trump campaign—for example, a story from a fake-news website claiming that protesters disrupting Trump’s rallies had been sent by Clinton (Persily, 2017).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Anti-Clinton messages were also traced to Russia, which effectively hacked into Clinton campaign emails, using bots (automated accounts that are difficult to trace) to spread information and fake news Russian operatives deemed harmful to Clinton or favorable to Trump. According to an official U.S. report from the Director of National Intelligence (DNI),</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. . . . Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations—such as cyber activity—with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or “trolls” (U.S. DNI, 2017).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While the Internet has the ability to foster democracy by encouraging widespread engagement in politics, information sharing, and the building of social movements, it also invites the participation of demagogues, extremists, Internet trolls seeking to create conflict, and foreign governments in domestic politics. The Internet can appeal to our best—and worst—impulses. The declining influence (and financial fortunes) of mainstream media has created an opening for the more direct communication that is made possible by the Internet—a world in which anyone with a smartphone or laptop computer can become a blogger, a source of information, a potential player in a presidential election. Yet, while anyone can post a message, not every message gets read. One study of the top 10 bloggers (the heads of liberal websites such as Daily Kos or conservative websites such as Instapundit) found that half were professional journalists from mainstream news organizations; eight were educated at elite institutions of higher education (seven had a PhD, one a JD); and only one was a woman (Hindman, 2008).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">To the extent that established institutions lose their power, the Internet can fill the political void in a way that favors populist movements: It enables the leaders of such movements to directly reach their followers, without the need for established political parties or mainstream media. Will this encourage the rise of pro-democracy movements—as it did briefly in the “Arab Spring” of 2010–2012? Or will it fuel the rise of populist authoritarian social movements, as it has in Turkey, India, and in European countries such as Hungary, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Austria, Germany, and Sweden?</p>
