<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When we say “the people rule,” we are typically referring such a right to an entity called a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-nation-state" href="part0084_split_003.html#nation-state">nation-state</a>—an entity composed of a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-nation" href="part0084_split_003.html#nation">nation</a> (people with a common identity that ideally includes shared culture, language, and feelings of belonging) and a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-state" href="part0084_split_003.html#state">state</a> (a political apparatus or government that rules over a territory). A modern state claims a specific territory and includes institutions such as a congress or parliament, a president or prime minister, judges, and other public <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_458" title="458"></span>officials; its authority is often backed by a legal system and the ability to use military force to implement its policies.</p>
<section id="characteristics-of-the-state">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Characteristics of the State</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Sovereignty</b> The territories ruled by traditional states were poorly defined, the level of control wielded by the central government being quite weak. The notion of national <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-sovereignty" href="part0084_split_003.html#sovereignty">sovereignty</a>—that a government possesses authority over an area with clear-cut borders, within which it is the supreme power—is a relatively modern one. All modern nation-states are sovereign states. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-failed-states" href="part0084_split_003.html#failed-states">Failed states</a> exist when the central government has lost authority over large parts of its national territory and resorts to the use of deadly force, often against civilian populations, in an effort to retain some degree of power. Examples today include Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen (<i class="italic">Foreign Policy</i>, 2013).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Nationalism</b> Nation-states are associated with the rise of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-nationalism" href="part0084_split_003.html#nationalism">nationalism</a>, which can be defined as a set of symbols and beliefs that creates a sense of membership in a single political community—such as being American, Canadian, or Russian. Although people may have always identified with their family, village, or religious community, nationalism appeared only with the development of the modern state. It is the main expression of identity with a distinct political community.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Nationalistic loyalties do not always fit the physical borders marking nations’ territories. Because all nation-states comprise communities of diverse backgrounds, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-local-nationalism" href="part0084_split_003.html#local-nationalism">local nationalism</a> frequently arises in opposition to that fostered by the state—such as nationalist feelings among the French-speaking population in Québec, Canada. While the relation between the nation-state and nationalism is complicated, the two are part of the same process. (We will return to nationalism when we explore its effect on international politics.)</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Power and Authority</b> For states to operate effectively, they must have <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-power" href="part0084_split_003.html#power">power</a>—the ability of individuals or groups to make their own interests or concerns count, even when others resist. Power, therefore, sometimes involves the use of force. Power is present in almost all social relationships: between parent and child, professor and student, employer and employee. The exercise of power is, in turn, almost always accompanied by belief systems that justify its use. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-authority" href="part0084_split_003.html#authority">Authority</a> is a form of power that is seen as rightfully exercised, or (to use a term preferred by sociologists and political scientists) “legitimate.” Those who are subject to a government’s authority voluntarily consent to it. Contrary to what many <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_459" title="459"></span>believe, democracy is not the only type of legitimate government. Dictatorships can have legitimacy as well, as can states governed by religious leaders.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Citizenship</b> Before the emergence of modern societies, most people lacked awareness or even interest in those who governed them; moreover, they had no political rights or influence. Normally, only the dominant classes or richest groups felt a sense of belonging to a political community. In modern societies, by contrast, most people living within the borders of the political system are <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-citizens" href="part0084_split_003.html#citizens">citizens</a>, individuals having common rights and duties, who know they are members of a common national community (Brubaker, 1992). Although some people are political refugees or are “stateless,” almost everyone in the world today identifies as a member of some national political order.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><b class="bold1">Citizenship Rights</b> Three types of rights are associated with citizenship (Marshall, 1973). First, <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-civil-rights" href="part0084_split_003.html#civil-rights">civil rights</a> are rights of the individual as established by law; these include privileges that took a long time to achieve and are not fully recognized in all countries. Examples are the freedom of individuals to live where they choose, freedom of speech and religion, the right to own property, and the right to equal justice before the law. These rights were not fully established in most European countries until the early nineteenth century, and not all groups were allowed the same privileges. Although the U.S. Constitution granted such rights to Americans well before most European states had them, African Americans were excluded until the mid-nineteenth century. Even after the Civil War, when Blacks legally obtained these rights, they were unable to exercise them. Blacks were assured full legal equality only with the passage of <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_460" title="460"></span>the Civil Rights Act of 1964—and then only because of more than a decade of marches, demonstrations, and nonviolent civil disobedience led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and countless others in the civil rights movement (Branch, 1989).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Women also were denied many civil rights; at the turn of the nineteenth century in the United States, women had few rights independent of their husbands. They could not own property, write wills, collect an inheritance, or even earn a salary. Throughout the nineteenth century, states slowly and gradually began affording such rights to women, regardless of their marital status (Speth, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The second type of citizenship rights consists of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-political-rights" href="part0084_split_003.html#political-rights">political rights</a>, especially the right to participate in elections and run for public office. Again, these rights were not won easily or quickly. In the United States, the achievement of full voting rights even for all men is relatively recent; it occurred only after the African American struggle for civil rights. In most European countries, the vote was at first limited to male citizens owning a certain amount of property—in other words, an affluent minority. In most Western countries, the vote for women was achieved partly through the efforts of women’s movements and partly as a consequence of women entering the formal economy early in the twentieth century, during World War I. As recently as September 2011, Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah officially granted women the right to vote and run in local elections.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The third type of citizenship rights consists of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-rights" href="part0084_split_003.html#social-rights">social rights</a>—the right of every individual to enjoy a minimum standard of economic welfare and security. Social rights include sickness benefits, unemployment benefits, and a guaranteed minimum wage—in other words, welfare provisions. In most societies, social rights developed last because the establishment of civil and political rights underpinned the fight for social rights. Social rights have been won largely as a result of the political strength that poorer groups have been able to develop after obtaining the vote.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Social rights are typically achieved through a <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-welfare-state" href="part0084_split_003.html#welfare-state">welfare state</a>, which exists when government organizations provide material benefits for citizens. Some of these benefits are intended to help those who cannot support themselves adequately through paid employment—the unemployed, the sick, the disabled, and the elderly. Many benefits go to the middle class as well: free or low-cost public education from kindergarten through state colleges and universities (although the cost of the latter is rapidly rising in many states), freeways, and Social Security, to <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_461" title="461"></span>name a few examples. In Western countries, an extensive welfare state has been considered the ideal expression of citizenship rights for more than half a century; however, in many poorer countries, welfare benefits, especially for the poor, are virtually nonexistent.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although an extensive welfare state was seen as the culmination of the development of citizenship rights, in recent years, welfare states have come under pressure from increasing global economic competition and the movement of people from poorer, often war-torn, countries to richer ones. As a result, the United States and some European countries have sought to reduce benefits to noncitizens and to prevent new immigrants from entering their borders. For example, for many years the U.S. government has patrolled its border with Mexico and constructed walls of concrete and barbed wire in an attempt to keep undocumented immigrants out of the country—an issue that resurfaced during the 2016 presidential campaign. In 2015, more than a million refugees from civil war and religious violence in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries fled their homelands and sought asylum in Europe, straining resources and provoking an anti-immigrant backlash among some segments of the European population. Citizenship, and the bundle of rights and privileges accompanying it, serves as a powerful instrument of social closure (Brubaker, 1992), whereby prosperous nation-states have attempted to exclude the migrant poor from the status and the benefits that citizenship confers. Concern over immigrants was one of the driving forces behind the 2016 British vote to leave the European Union (the so-called “Brexit”), and contributed to Donald Trump’s electoral victory in the U.S. 2016 presidential race (during the campaign, one of Trump’s promises was to “build a wall” between the United States and Mexico and make Mexico pay for it).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Social change sometimes occurs outside the established political system. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-revolutions" href="part0084_split_003.html#revolutions">Revolutions</a> occur when an existing political order is overthrown by means of a mass movement that emerges when desired changes cannot be achieved within the system, often using violence (Foran, 1997, 2005). Yet for all their high drama, revolutions occur relatively infrequently. More commonly, political change is achieved through <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-movements" href="part0084_split_003.html#social-movements">social movements</a>—collective attempts to further a common interest or secure a common goal through action outside the sphere of established institutions. Social movements are as evident in the contemporary world as are the formal, bureaucratic organizations they often oppose. Many contemporary social movements are international and utilize information technology in linking local campaigners to global issues.</p>
