<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Perhaps the most influential, and controversial, theory of the emergence of gender identity is that of Sigmund Freud. According to Freud, the learning of gender differences in infants and young children centers on the possession or absence of the penis. “I have a penis” is equivalent to “I am a boy,” while “I am a girl” is equivalent to “I lack a penis.” Freud is careful to say that it is not just the anatomical distinctions that matter; the possession and absence of the penis are symbolic of masculinity and femininity, of power and lack of power, respectively.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Major objections have been raised against Freud’s views, particularly by feminists but also by many other authors (Coward, 1984; Mitchell, 1975). First, Freud seems to identify gender identity too closely with genital awareness; other more subtle factors are surely involved. Second, the theory seems to depend on the notion that the penis is superior to the vagina, which is thought of as just a lack of the male organ. Yet why shouldn’t the female genitals be considered superior to those of the male?</p>
