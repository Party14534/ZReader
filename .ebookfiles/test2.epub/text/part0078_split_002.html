<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">How Do People Age?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In examining the nature of aging, we will draw on studies of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-gerontology" href="part0078_split_003.html#social-gerontology">social gerontology</a>, a discipline concerned with the study of the social aspects of aging. Studying aging requires a sociological imagination. How people experience old age is shaped by social and historical context (Riley, Foner, and Waring, 1988). For Americans born in the first quarter of the twentieth century, a high school education was regarded as more than sufficient for most available jobs, and most people did not expect to live much past their sixties—and then only at the cost of suffering a variety of disabilities. Today, those very same people find themselves in their seventies and eighties; many are relatively healthy, unwilling to disengage from work or social life, and in need of more schooling than they ever dreamed would be necessary to compete in today’s information-based economy.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What does it mean to age? <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-aging" href="part0078_split_003.html#aging">Aging</a> can be defined as the combination of biological, psychological, and social processes that affect people as they grow older (Abeles and Riley, 1987; Atchley, 2000; Riley, Foner, and Waring, 1988). These processes can be thought of as three different, although interrelated, developmental clocks: (1) biological, which refers to the physical body; (2) psychological, which refers to the mind, including one’s mental, emotional, and cognitive capabilities; and (3) social, which refers to cultural norms, values, and role expectations related to age. There is an enormous <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_423" title="423"></span>range of variation in all three of these processes. The very meaning of old age is changing rapidly, both because research is dispelling many outdated notions about aging and because advances in nutrition, health, and medical technology now enable many people to live longer, healthier lives than ever before.</p>
<section id="biological-aging">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Biological Aging</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The biological effects of aging are well established, although the exact chronological age at which they occur varies greatly depending on one’s genes, lifestyle, and luck. In general, for men and women alike, biological aging typically means:</p>
<ul class="contents">
<li class="bcpt"><span>Declining vision, as the eye lens loses its elasticity</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>Hearing loss, first of higher-pitched tones, then of lower-pitched ones</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>Wrinkles, as the skin’s underlying structure becomes more and more brittle</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>A decline in muscle mass and an accompanying accumulation of fat, especially around the abdomen</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>A drop in cardiovascular efficiency, as less oxygen can be inhaled and used during exercise</span></li>
<li class="bcpt"><span>Declining immune function, and less capacity to fight viruses</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The latter condition, in particular, is one reason why older adults have been particularly vulnerable to both contracting and dying of COVID-19. Older adults make up just 16 percent of the U.S. population, but they accounted for one-third of all cases, 45 percent of all hospitalizations, and 80 percent of deaths associated with COVID-19. This risk of death increased steadily with age, with persons ages 85+ three times more likely than those ages 65 to 84 from die from COVID-19 (CDC COVID-19 Response Team, 2020a). However, it is important to once again point out the vast diversity among older adults. Those persons most vulnerable to COVID-19 are those with underlying health conditions, a factor that is related to old age but not synonymous with it. Many older adults have no underlying conditions, and as such are not particularly vulnerable to the virus.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet despite troubling media images of older adults’ deaths from COVID-19, many older adults fared safely during the pandemic. Biological aspects of aging are inevitable, but they can be partly delayed by good health, low to modest levels of stress, proper diet and nutrition, and regular participation in vigorous exercise (Butler, 2010). Lifestyle can make a significant health difference for people of all ages. Some scientists have even argued that with a healthy lifestyle and advances in medical technology, more and more people will be able to live relatively illness-free lives until they reach their biological maximum, experiencing only a brief period of sickness just before death (Fries, 1980; Vaupel et al., 1998). Eventually, of course, the biological clock runs out for everyone. About 90 to 100 years seems to be the upper end of the genetically determined age distribution for most human beings, although some have argued that it may be as high as 120 (Fries, 1980; Olshansky, Carnes, and Grahn, 2003).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Gerontologists agree that senescence, or physical decline that accompanies aging, is inevitable. However, today’s older adults now have unprecedented access to many assistive technologies that enable them to live full and active lives. These are products that increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities. Such products range from hearing aids and eyeglasses to canes, walkers, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_424" title="424"></span>and “grabbers” (which help frail older adults reach a box of cereal on a high shelf in their kitchen), to computer-screen magnifiers and oversize kitchen utensils. Gerontologists also consider household modifications, such as chair lifts, wheelchair ramps, and grab bars in the shower, as assistive devices.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A recent study found that about 30 percent of older adults had used a mobility device, including a cane, walker, wheelchair, or scooter, in the last month (Freedman et al., 2013). One of the most important benefits of such devices is that they enable older adults to maintain their independence, keep up daily routines, and stay in their own homes (rather than move to an assisted-living facility) for as long as possible. These devices are particularly helpful for preventing falls; one-third of persons over age 65 report a fall each year, making falls the leading cause of accidents and a common trigger of hospitalizations among older adults (Center for Technology and Aging, 2010). In this way, technological advances have altered the impact of biological aging on older adults’ lives.</p>

<section id="psychological-aging">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Psychological Aging</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The psychological effects of aging are less well established than the physical effects. Even though memory, intelligence, reasoning skills, and both the capacity and motivation to learn are widely assumed to decline with age, research into the psychology of aging suggests a much more complicated process (Schaie and Willis, 2010). For most people, memory and learning ability, for example, do not decline significantly until very late in life, although the speed with which one recalls or analyzes information may slow somewhat, giving the false impression of mental impairment. For most older adults whose lives are stimulating and rich, such mental abilities as motivation to learn, clarity of thought, creativity, and problem-solving capacity do not decline significantly until the late eighties (Cohen, 2005; Atchley, 2000).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Even <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-alzheimer-s-disease" href="part0078_split_003.html#alzheimer-s-disease">Alzheimer’s disease</a>—the progressive deterioration of brain cells that is the primary cause of dementia in old age—is relatively rare in noninstitutionalized persons under 75, although it afflicts about one-third (32 percent) of all people over 85 and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States (Alzheimer’s Association, 2017). Given the projected steep growth in the number of persons 85 and older in the coming decades, caring for and treating Alzheimer’s patients will be an important challenge. An estimated 5.6 million older <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_425" title="425"></span>adults currently suffer from Alzheimer’s disease. This number is expected to increase by almost 35 percent, to 7.1 million older adults, by 2025 and may nearly triple by 2050.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Scientists have recently developed new technologies that enable an earlier and more accurate detection of dementia and Alzheimer’s. This advance holds great promise for treating patients before the disease progresses too far (Alzheimer’s Association, 2017). Former president Ronald Reagan is perhaps the most famous example of someone who suffered from Alzheimer’s; his wife Nancy Reagan spoke out publicly about the profound physical and emotional challenges of providing care to an Alzheimer’s patient and called for the use of stem-cell research to find a cure (Collins, 2004). Gerontologists are cautiously optimistic about the promise of science to help fight the ravages of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<section id="social-aging-section">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Social Aging</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-social-aging" href="part0078_split_003.html#social-aging">Social aging</a> refers to the norms, values, and roles that are culturally associated with a particular chronological age. Historically, social roles in the United States have been closely tied to one’s age. The role of “student” was held by young people, while the roles of “worker” (typically for men) and “parent” (typically for women) were held by young adults and middle-aged persons, and the role of “retiree” was reserved for older adults. Social roles also were highly age segregated; the only “old” person in a college classroom was typically the professor.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Throughout the twentieth century, however, links between age and social roles have grown more tenuous, and social roles have become less segregated by age. For example, as young people stay in school longer and graduate from school later, they delay the traditional markers of “adulthood”—full-time employment, marriage, childbearing, and home ownership—until their thirties, forties, and even later. Young people in their twenties and thirties are living with their parents, unable to afford their own apartments against the backdrop of the Great Recession (Parker, 2012). People who become new parents for the first time in their forties are parents to young adults at age 65, while in prior generations, most people aged 65 were happily settled into the role of grandparent or even great-grandparent.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Similarly, changes in the labor force mean that adults are working into late life and many need to retrain or retool their skills. “Nontraditional age” students now represent nearly 50 percent of college enrollment. Many older adults saw their pensions, home values, and savings evaporate in the recession that began in 2007, forcing them to delay their retirement past age 65. Some remain in their lifelong jobs, while others cut back to part-time hours or take “bridge” (transitional) jobs between their full-time lifelong job and retirement (Sackmann and Wingens, 2003). Yet, retirement is no longer the exclusive domain of older adults. Some middle-aged adults, especially those in high-paying jobs, may be forced to retire early <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_426" title="426"></span>if their companies can no longer afford to employ them—instead hiring less skilled, less costly younger workers.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Social aging, like biological and psychological aging, has been transformed by technology. In earlier decades, older adults (especially women) were considered physically undesirable because they defied the cultural standard of youthful beauty. Today, cosmetic surgery helps older women (and men, to a lesser extent) maintain a taut, dewy complexion via processes such as Botox injections and face lifts, and a svelte physique via procedures such as tummy tucks and liposuction (Brooks, 2017). The cultural belief that older adults are uninterested in sex or incapable of maintaining a healthy sex life has been shattered by the development of impotence drugs such as Viagra (Loe, 2004). In the United States today, virility drugs top $5 billion in annual sales. Social scientists agree that, more than ever before, age is “just a number.”</p>
