<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In past economic downturns—beginning with the New Deal policies enacted by the FDR administration during the Great Depression of the 1930s—government transfers helped to blunt the effects. Unemployment insurance, welfare benefits, antipoverty programs, and government stimulus spending helped to create jobs, benefiting those at the bottom and thereby reducing inequality. These reforms also helped to reduce inequality in the long run by transferring wealth (in the form of higher taxes) from richer Americans to poorer Americans. Can contemporary government policies effectively reduce poverty?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Critics of government spending on poverty alleviation argue that it promotes “welfare dependency,” meaning that poor people become materially and psychologically dependent on the very programs that are supposed to enable them to become independent. Others deny that such dependency is widespread. “Being on welfare” is a source of shame, they say, and most people on welfare usually try to escape from it.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Recently, we have seen a shift in public opinion with regard to the role of government in helping the poor. The Pew Research Center regularly asks a national sample of Americans whether they believe that “poor people today have it easy because they can get government benefits without doing anything in return,” as opposed to “poor <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_279" title="279"></span>people have hard lives because government benefits don’t go far enough to help them live decently.” The 2014 poll found that 47 percent chose the former option, while 43 percent chose the latter. Twenty years ago, the split was 53 percent to 39 percent. There has been a clear shift in opinion toward the belief that the government is failing to do enough to help the poor (Horowitz et al., 2020b).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">President Bill Clinton enacted sweeping welfare reform designed to get people off the welfare rolls. In a sense, this law provided a test case of the “welfare dependency” thesis. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which took effect in 1997, replaced earlier welfare programs by requiring that welfare recipients begin work after receiving benefits for only two years; families would be cut off entirely after a cumulative five years of assistance. Before this reform, the federal government imposed no time limits or work requirements on welfare recipients, many of whom are single mothers.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">On the one hand, the welfare-to-work approach was a resounding success: It reduced welfare claims from 5.1 million families to 2.7 million families in the first three years. Employment rates did increase somewhat among welfare recipients, and the 61 percent of those who left welfare were able to find work. On the other hand, nearly one out of every five welfare recipients was unable to find work (or, indeed, any source of independent income), while another fifth was forced to rely on romantic partners, family members, or private charities for support. About half of those who did get a job wound up earning less than they had received on welfare; less than a quarter had health insurance through their employer (Loprest, 1999). For low-income mothers, the costs of leaving welfare for work can outweigh the advantages since they <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_280" title="280"></span>face expenses for food, rent, child care, and other necessities that often exceed their income. In addition, their jobs tend to be less stable and pay less than welfare (Edin and Lein, 1997).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Thus, critics argue that the apparent success of welfare-to-work initiatives conceals troublesome patterns in the experiences of those who lose their welfare benefits. Moreover, even the most hopeful studies were conducted during a period of economic expansion. When growth slows, or declines, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, for welfare recipients to find any jobs at all.</p>
