<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">The Environment: A Sociological Issue</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The environment is a central concern for sociology. Growing human population, industrialization, and the concentration of people in enormous metropolitan areas have resulted in environmental challenges that play out on a planetary scale. Earth system scientists now agree: Humans play a starring role in global warming and climate change. Sociologists therefore have a role to play in understanding how social behavior may determine the environmental fate of the planet.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">The New Ecological Paradigm in Sociology</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><span>A change in thinking about human–environmental relations emerged in the 1970s.</span> Classical sociology had tended to minimize, if not completely ignore, the importance of human impacts on the environment. This was partly because the negative impacts were less pervasive (recall that by 1900 there were still fewer than 2 billion people in the world), but primarily because sociology, like much of social science thought, generally took for granted human domination of nature (Leiss, 1994).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As we saw in <a href="part0009_split_000.html#8IL20-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 1</a>, sociology emerged during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a period that reflected what has been termed “optimistic ethnocentrism” during an “age of exuberance” (Catton and Dunlap, 1980). This refers to the belief that science, technology, and industrial development, fueled by vast lands and resources in North and South America, as well as a seemingly endless supply of fossil fuel, would provide for limitless opportunity and endless progress. This view has been termed the <i class="italic">Human Exceptionalism Paradigm</i> (HEP), reflecting the belief that humans are unique among all creatures: We dominate all species and can remake the world to serve our needs, since human destiny is shaped by social and cultural factors and not the physical environment (Catton and Dunlap, 1980).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This view held sway until the early 1970s, when it was seriously challenged by a growing number of sociologists and ecologists. This was a period during which social movements were already questioning prevailing worldviews, including the taken-for-granted assumption that human life could somehow be divorced from the natural world. The HEP was further challenged when an offshore oil-drilling platform in the Santa Barbara Channel in California blew out in early 1969, covering miles of pristine coastline with oil, killing thousands of birds and creating the largest ecological disaster in U.S. history. The oil spill received widespread media attention; President Nixon even paid a visit. It inspired the first Earth Day, as well as one of the country’s first environmental studies programs, at UC Santa Barbara. The oil spill also highlighted the tensions between the petroleum industry and local residents, raising questions about the nature of power in America (Molotch, 1970). Popular books such as Rachel Carson’s <i class="italic">Silent Spring</i> (1962), which exposed the effects of pesticides on water, had already raised public awareness about environmental issues. The Club of Rome’s <i class="italic">Limits to Growth</i> study (Meadows et al., 1972<i class="italic">)</i>, which used computer modeling to analyze the complex interaction among such factors as <span>population, food production, industrialization, capital flows, pollution, and natural resources, predicted global economic and demographic collapse before the year 2100.</span></p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The change in thinking about human–environmental relations that emerged in the 1970s was labeled the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), a framework that emphasized the complex interactions involved in global ecosystems. Humans, it argued, are not somehow exempt from the “web of nature,” and our biophysical environment is not limitless. On the contrary, the carrying capacity of our planet is limited, and we must come to understand and respect these limits, or we will pay a price (Catton and Dunlap, 1980; Schnaiberg, 1980; Dunlap, 2002; Buttel, 1987; Freudenberg, Frickel, and Gramling, 1995).</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_792" title="792"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologist Allen Schnaiberg’s influential book, <i class="italic">The Environment: From Surplus to Scarcity</i> (1980), argued that in the post–World War II period, capitalism’s profit-driven need to produce and sell more and more products had resulted in an ever-expanding global demand for natural resources and cheap labor. The resulting adverse environmental impacts were seen as especially felt in developing countries, where natural resources and cheap labor are found and extracted by firms in wealthy industrial countries. Rich countries therefore export their pollution and natural resource depletion to poor, less developed ones. Economics trumps ecology; labor, capital, and states all share an interest in economic expansion that interact in a system bent on ecological degradation. As technological innovation speeds the process, natural resources are depleted and environmental destruction becomes widespread in Schnaiberg’s phrase a “treadmill of production” that increases in speed with ever diminished returns, resulting in toxic planetary ecological effects.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Schnaiberg’s work is credited with creating the field of environmental sociology (Islam, 2015; Gould, Pellow, and Schnaiberg, 2004, 2008), which is concerned with examining the relationships between social systems and the ecosphere. Environmental sociologists study such areas as the origins and impacts of technology, the relationship between social change and environmental change, and the role of social inequality and power relationships in shaping human interactions with the environment (American Sociological Association, 2019). The once-radical ideas of the early environmental sociologists have by now become mainstream in environmental sociology (Pellow and Brehm, 2013, 2015).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The New Ecological Paradigm challenged another sociological theory about human–environmental relations that emerged at roughly the same time, Ecological Modernization Theory. Just as classical Modernization Theory (discussed in <a href="part0053_split_000.html#1IHDQ0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 8</a>) argued that when poor countries pursue certain economic and technological policies they can find a path to economic development, Ecological Modernization Theory argued that when poor countries develop economically, they also turn a corner and reduce their environmental impact. This notion is embodied in the so-called Environmental Kuznets Curve, which predicts that during early stages of economic development, economic growth (measured, for example, by a country’s per-capita income) results in environmental degradation; but that when a certain level of development is reached, policies and technologies are adopted that reduce environmental impact. The Environmental Kuznets Curve, like the original Kuznets Curve (also discussed in <a href="part0053_split_000.html#1IHDQ0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 8</a>), thus argues that a form of inequality increases during early stages of capitalist economic development, then declines at later stages—in this case, environmental inequality rather than income inequality (Dinda, 2004). If the New Ecological Paradigm viewed economic degradation as a largely inevitable result of capitalism, Ecological Modernization Theory argued that a combination of scientific and technological advances, market reforms, new forms of governance, and social movements could make a difference (Jänicke, 1991; Spaargare and Mol, 1992; Jänicke and Weidner, 1995; Neale, 1997; Mol and Sonnenfeld, 2000). The former called for radical changes in existing economic systems; the latter favored reforms, possibly in part because the early scholars were largely European, where national policies tended to be more disposed toward environmental protection than those of the United States.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Global Environmental Threats</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The spread of industrial production may already have done irreparable damage to the environment. Ecological questions concern not only how we can best cope with and contain environmental damage but also the very ways of life within industrialized societies. Economic development in many countries has meant that more people are living under better conditions than a half century ago, thanks to rising levels of consumption: As living standards rise, people are able to afford more food, clothing, personal items, leisure time, vacations, cars, travel, and all the goods and services associated with middle-class life. But rapidly expanding global consumption requires energy to produce and transport goods, which pollutes the environment. During the twenty-year period from 1997 to 2017, per-person income, one measure of consumption, in the world as a whole increased by nearly 40 percent. In China, now the world’s second largest economy, per-person income increased more than fourfold during the same period (World Bank, 2019k). If China, with nearly a fifth of the world population, reaches its understandable goal of achieving economic parity with the United States and other advanced industrial countries, the environmental impact of such massive consumption could be extreme.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to one popular website, Global Footprint Network, if all people on earth were somehow to achieve the standard of living of the average American, it would require seven planets to feed, clothe, shelter, and provide the countless consumer items that make up what most of us consider a decent life. While such calculations are perhaps somewhat fanciful, the overall message is not: Our current path, whether as a nation or as all humanity, is no longer sustainable. Technological progress is, of course, unpredictable, and it may be that the earth will, in fact, yield sufficient resources to permit global industrialization without it resulting in irreversible ecological changes to the planet. At the moment, however, this does not seem feasible, and if the countries in the global south are to achieve living standards comparable to those currently enjoyed in the West, global readjustments will be necessary.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Global environmental threats are of several basic sorts: global warming and climate change, the loss of biodiversity, food insecurity, and environmental injustice. We will look at each of these in turn, before turning to a consideration of what is being done to address them.</p>

<section id="global-warming-and-climate-change-welcome-to-the-anthropocene">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Global Warming and Climate Change: Welcome to the Anthropocene</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There is consensus in the scientific community that the earth is getting warmer, even more quickly than was believed to be the case a decade ago, and that the human use of energy—coal, oil, and gas—is largely responsible. Global warming occurs because carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere by the burning of fuels such as oil and coal in cars and power stations, as well as gases released into the air by the use of such things as aerosols, material for insulation, and air-conditioning units. This buildup of greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere functions like the glass of a greenhouse. The atmosphere allows the sun’s rays to pass through but acts as a barrier to prevent the rays from passing back, causing the Earth <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_794" title="794"></span>to heat up. For this reason, global warming is sometimes termed the “greenhouse effect.” Atmospheric carbon dioxide, which has been increasing since the Industrial Revolution, has risen steeply in the last half century, and now exceeds 400 parts per million (climate scientists believe that once carbon dioxide levels reach 450 parts per million, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to keep global temperatures from increasing more than 2 degrees Centigrade). It is estimated that nearly half (47 percent) of atmospheric carbon dioxide has resulted from human activities since the Industrial Revolution, with more than half of all industrial emissions reportedly occurring in the last 30 years (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Frumhoff, 2014).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The U.S. Energy Information Administration (2016) projected that worldwide energy use will increase by nearly 50 percent between 2012 and 2040, and more than half of that increase will occur in China and India. In 2010, those two countries accounted for 24 percent of the total growth in energy use. If current trends continue, the EIA predicts that by 2040, China will be using more than twice the energy of the United States (Figure 19.2). Despite breakthroughs in renewable energy, it is predicted that fossil fuels will still comprise more than three-quarters of global energy consumption.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most of America’s energy currently comes from nonrenewable fossil fuels—mainly petroleum and, to a lesser degree, coal and natural gas. According to U.S. government figures, the United States consumes 21 percent of the world’s petroleum, 22 percent of its natural gas, and 11 percent of its coal, and produces 16 percent of all carbon emissions that result from fossil-fuel consumption (U.S. EIA, 2017). Since the United States has less than 5 percent of the world’s population, it is clearly consuming a greatly enlarged share of global energy reserves. This is what sociologist Bill Freudenberg termed the <i class="italic">disproportionality thesis</i>, according to which a vastly disproportionate amount of environmental harm is being done by a small number of countries, in which the United States is a principal actor (Freudenberg, 2006).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While China’s growth is predicted to greatly increase its use of energy, it is currently second to the United States, consuming 13 percent of the world’s petroleum (US EIA, 2019c). Unlike the United States, China relies heavily on coal, which produces more carbon dioxide than petroleum to produce the same amount of energy, although it is in the process of shutting down its most polluting coal plants and switching to “clean coal” as well as renewables. When all greenhouse gases are taken into account, China surpassed the United States as the world’s largest emitter in 2005, and currently accounts for 27 percent of the world total, twice the share of the United States (13 percent). Yet when making comparisons it is important to bear in mind that China is an industrializing country with four times the U.S. population. On a per person basis, the United States is by far the world’s largest producer of greenhouse gases: It currently emits twice as much carbon dioxide per person as China (Oliver and Peters, 2018). Also recall that China’s greenhouse gas emissions come in large part from factories that are making products that we all consume, for firms that are headquartered in the United States, Europe, and Japan. In an important sense, therefore, the production of greenhouse gases has been outsourced to firms in China as well as other industrializing countries.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a blue-ribbon group of scientists from 195 countries created by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization in 1988, took the planet’s temperature and found it had already increased by 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times (the period 1850–1900 is used as an approximation) and has been rising steeply since the mid-twentieth century. Rising temperatures result in the rapid shrinking of Arctic ice caps, along with mountain glaciers; long-term droughts in some regions, with greater rainfall in others; an increase in hurricane activity in the North Atlantic; and, in general, more turbulence in global weather. Most significantly, the 2007 IPCC report stated unequivocally that human activity was the principal source of global warming, very likely causing most of the temperature increase over the last century.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">By 2014, when the IPCC issued its synthesis report based on the most recent research, the experts warned of “severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems,” including continued global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, more frequent and longer-lasting heat waves, and more extreme weather such as tropical storms, cyclones, and hurricanes. The best hope was to limit the total increase to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels, which meant only another 0.5 degree Celsius (0.9 degree Fahrenheit) from current levels (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2015). The 2014 IPCC report suggested ways to mitigate the worst consequences of global warming. The first and most important step would be for the countries of the world to adopt conservation measures that would limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius (and, as noted above, 1.5 degrees Celsius is necessary if major climate changes are to be avoided). This would require national policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn would require massive conversion from economies based on fossil fuels to economies based on clean energy. In December 2015, 195 nations met in Paris and reached an agreement to limit temperature increase to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Each country agreed to submit a climate plan. The United States, for example, committed to a 2025 goal of greenhouse-gas emissions 26 percent to 28 percent lower than they were in 2005. China took a somewhat different approach, pledging to lower emissions per unit of GDP by 60 to 65 percent (which would mean total emissions would continue to rise at least until 2030, since China hopes to continue building its rapidly growing <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_796" title="796"></span>GDP). The Paris Agreement also included a “loss and damage” principle, under which wealthy countries agreed to create a fund to help poorer countries cope with the effects of global warming (UNFCC, 2015).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While the Paris Agreement was historically significant and was seen by many as a hopeful sign, it is unclear whether it will be honored. There are no enforcement mechanisms, apart from regular public reports that may shame countries into fulfilling their commitments. The IPCC, in its October 2018 Special Report, expressed grave concerns, commenting “that we are already seeing the consequences of 1°C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes.” The report also noted that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, despite pledges from virtually every country to lower them, and that substantial action by governments and the private sector are required if the goal of limiting temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius is to be realized. The report gave the world less than a dozen years (until 2030) to achieve the 1.5 degree Celsius goal, after which it predicted far greater risks of droughts, floods, and extreme heat waves, all of which could result in poverty for hundreds of millions of people (Watts, 2018). “Now more than ever,” the IPCC report concludes, “unprecedented and urgent action is required of all nations” if the world is to avoid extreme hot days, an increase in heavy rainfalls and flooding in some areas and prolonged droughts in others, stronger melting of ice sheets and glaciers and a resulting increased sea level rise (IPCC, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A separate IPCC report on the oceans, glaciers, and permafrost, published a year later, noted a significant shrinkage of the earth’s glaciers, snow cover, and Arctic sea ice, a warming of the oceans, and a melting of northern permafrost in recent decades (IPCC, 2019b). According to the report, melting glaciers have resulted in sea levels that have risen more in the past century than at any time during the past several thousand years, and resulted in coastal flooding. The predicted increase in average global temperature was sufficient, in the eyes of some scientists, to destabilize the ice sheets that cover Greenland and the western part of Antarctica; were they to melt in their entirety, sea levels would rise an estimated 30 feet or more. While such a catastrophic event seems unlikely in the foreseeable future, in 2019 the Greenland ice sheet lost 300 billion tons of ice, far more than normal, the result of record hot weather during the summer months (Tutton, 2019; NSIDC, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The report also noted an increase in tropical cyclones, rainfall, and winds from warming oceans; threats to ecologically (and economically) important animal plant species; wildfires in many regions; and negative impacts on food security and water. For the first time, the IPCC also emphasized the negative effects on indigenous peoples, who depend most heavily on their natural surroundings for sustenance (IPCC, 2019b). The period 2001–2018 saw 17 of the 18 hottest years ever recorded; July 2019 was the hottest month since records have been kept. In the United States, wildfires now afflict large regions of the western United States, while storm surges and river flooding have plagued Houston and the Midwest. While specific weather events cannot be definitively tied to global climate change, it seems increasingly likely that warmer weather is a major cause.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Such global warming, in combination with population growth and urbanization, can have deadly consequences. One study predicts that heat-related deaths in India will double by 2080, the direct result of global warming (<i class="italic">Economic Times,</i> 2015); <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_797" title="797"></span>another study drew similar conclusions for New York City (Freedman, 2013). In Pakistan, 1,250 people died during a heat wave in June 2015, and during spring 2016, Karachi—Pakistan’s largest city, with more than 22 million people—began to run out of water, with people queuing up for hours for potable water that had to be brought in on trucks (Awaz.TV, 2016). Nor is Pakistan alone; currently, two-thirds of the global population “live in areas that experience water scarcity for at least one month a year” (UNESCO, 2017c). A November 2019 report in the prestigious medical journal <i class="italic">Lancet</i>, that drew on the findings of 35 leading academic institutions and UN agencies from every continent, concluded that if present trends continue, “a child born today will experience a world that is more than four degrees warmer than the pre-industrial average, with climate change impacting human health from infancy and adolescence to adulthood and old age,” noting that children and the 65+ population will suffer the greatest risks (Watts et al., 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While climate skeptics claim that climate scientists overstate the case for climate change, in fact the opposite is more likely: Advances in scientific knowledge and measurement have made it clear that the earliest scientific studies of climate change in fact underestimated the rate of change (Oreskes, Oppenheimer, and Jamieson, 2019; Oppenheimer et al., 2019; Linden, 2019). Debra Roberts, co-chair of the IPCC working group on impacts, warns that “it’s a line in the sand and what it says to our species is that this is the moment and we must act now. . . . This is the largest clarion bell from the science community, and I hope it mobilizes people and dents the mood of complacency” (Watts, 2018). Such changes have led to the claim that we are now experiencing a “climate emergency” that must be urgently addressed (Gills and Morgan, 2019; IPCC, 2018; Watts, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Such dramatic climate change, and the scientific consensus that they are the result of human activities, has led earth-system scientists to argue that we are now in a newly identified geological era: the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-anthropocene" href="part0124_split_006.html#anthropocene">Anthropocene</a> (Oldfield et al., 2018). At the turn of the twenty-first century, Paul Crutzen, an atmospheric chemist and recipient of the Nobel Prize in chemistry, popularized the term <i class="italic">Anthropocene</i> (“human epoch”) to characterize the current geological period, a time when human activities have become the main agent of change in our planetary ecosystem (Crutzen and Stoermer, 2000). This label has caught on: The term has appeared in hundreds of scientific publications, and the International Union of Geological Sciences, the organization charged with identifying geological periods, has convened scholars to decide whether the Holocene (the period that began after the last ice age, some 12,000 years ago, providing the conditions under which modern human societies developed) has been officially superseded by the Anthropocene (Stromberg, 2013). The term is significant, because it reflects the overwhelming scientific consensus that humans have become the driving force behind global ecological change, and that global warming has significantly altered the conditions that gave rise to the agricultural revolution and modern societies. It recognizes that an understanding of the Anthropocene requires that many different disciplines work together, “from engineering and environmental science to the social sciences and humanities” (Oldfield et al., 2018).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_4">Loss of Biodiversity</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-environmental-ecology" href="part0124_split_006.html#environmental-ecology">Environmental ecology,</a> the scientific study of the distribution and abundance of life and the interactions between organisms and their natural environment, highlights another challenge that results in part from global climate change: the planetary loss of biodiversity. According to a May 2019 UN report, “nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history—and the rate of species extinctions is accelerating, with grave impacts on people around the world now likely” (IPBES, 2019). The report, which drew on 15,000 scientific and government sources, concluded that up to a million animal and plant species are threatened with extinction, out of a total eight million currently existing species—a threat it says is unprecedented in human history. Among land-based, freshwater, and sea-based species that have been studied in detail, an estimated one out of every four is believed to be threatened. A third of all coral reefs are imperiled, threatening the loss of a key habitat for many ocean species, as well jeopardizing the welfare of those who depend on coral reefs for seafood, commercial fishing, and tourism. Even insects, which are vital for pollination of crops and plants, are in peril; as much as a tenth of all insect species are threatened (IPBES, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are many causes of biodiversity loss. Growing global population and urbanization have altered three-quarters of our planet’s land and two-thirds of its marine environments, with more than a third of all land and three-quarters of all freshwater resources now being used for crops or livestock. Deforestation, the result of timber harvesting, agricultural expansion, and fires, has increased significantly. Pollution from toxic industrial waste, runoff from fertilizers, and plastics has contributed to extensive ocean “dead zones”; plastic pollution alone has increased tenfold over the past 40 years. Global warming has made its own direct contribution to biodiversity loss, playing a role in massive forest fires, droughts, and flooding. As ocean temperatures have risen, and as the oceans absorb increasing amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide, they also lose oxygen and become increasing acidic, destroying coral reefs and threatening the sea life that depends on them. Global warming has also meant the extinction of existing species ill-suited to the rising temperatures, and their replacement by other “invasive” species that are better suited, further reducing biodiversity (NOAA, 2019; IPBES, 2019; IPCC, 2019b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Industrialized countries have become “throwaway societies,” polluting the environment by routinely discarding a staggering volume of items: When we buy food in grocery stores it is often wrapped in packages that are immediately discarded; products bought online arrive in cardboard or plastic, which winds up in garbage dumps (and often the ocean); electronic waste—computers, cell phones, and the host of toys and gadgets that contain electronic circuits—are routinely “recycled” to landfills in poor countries, where there are few, if any, safeguards against contaminating local watersheds, farmlands, and communities.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The loss of biodiversity means more to humans than the loss of natural habitat, although many would agree with the nineteenth-century American writer Henry David Thoreau’s spiritual musing, “In wilderness lies the preservation of the world.” Biodiversity also provides humans with new medicines and sources and varieties of food, and it plays a role in regulating <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_799" title="799"></span>atmospheric and oceanic chemistry. The recent UN report concludes that “ecosystems, species, wild populations, local varieties and breeds of domesticated plants and animals are shrinking, deteriorating or vanishing. The essential, interconnected web of life on Earth is getting smaller and increasingly frayed. This loss is a direct result of human activity and constitutes a direct threat to human well-being in all regions of the world” (IPBES, 2019).</p>

A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted that global food production is already challenged by increased population and rising incomes, the latter causing an increased demand for animal-sourced products that require additional land for livestock feed. Climate change is projected to worsen these stressors, with food insecurity found almost entirely in the developing world.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Persistent warming and long drought cycles, coupled with deforestation and land degradation, will have strong negative impacts on food production, the nutritional quality of the food that is produced, and increased damage from invasive pests and resulting crop diseases. Extreme climate change–related weather events, such as flooding, extreme heat, and associated droughts, will worsen food security still further. The result is “immediate and long-term impacts on livelihoods of poor and vulnerable communities, contributing to greater risks of food insecurity that can be a stress multiplier for internal and external migration” (IPCC, 2019a).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to a report by the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, an estimated 821 million people were already undernourished in 2017, especially in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Southeastern and Western Asia, and Latin America—a figure that, if current global warming trends continue, could rise to nearly a billion people by mid-century. The number at risk of hunger is predicted to increase by as much as 20 percent over the same period, with two-thirds located in sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the world’s poor live in rural areas; some 2.5 billion people depend on agriculture for their survival, providing food as well as household income. The UN report concludes that “climate change is undermining <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_800" title="800"></span>the right to food, with disproportionate impacts on those who have contributed least to global warming and are most vulnerable to its harmful effects” (Elver, 2015a).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_6">Environmental Injustice</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although the rich are the world’s main consumers, the environmental damage that is caused by growing consumption has the greatest effect on the poor. The wealthy are in a better position to enjoy the many benefits of consumption without having to deal with its negative effects. The poor are the most vulnerable, since they lack access to the resources that might enable them to adjust to climate change. Sociologist Robert Bullard (1996) pioneered the concept of environmental justice, based on the principle that all people and communities are entitled to equal protection of a country’s environmental and public health laws and regulations. Bullard studied the ways in which toxic environments in the United States, such as the location of highly polluting industrial plants, fell most heavily on the poor and racial minorities. Chemical plants, power stations, major roads, railways, and airports are often sited close to low-income areas. As Bullard succinctly summarizes his four decades of research, “Individuals who physically live on the ‘wrong side of the tracks’ are subjected to elevated environmental health threats and more than their fair share of preventable diseases” (Bullard, 2020).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">With increased attention to the global environmental implications of climate change, Bullard’s arguments have been extended globally (Agyeman, Bullard, and Edwards, 2003; Bullard, 2005; Bullard et al., 2016; Elver, 2015b) The notion of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-environmental-injustice" href="part0124_split_006.html#environmental-injustice">environmental injustice</a>—that the harms suffered by ecosystems today are closely linked to and mirror the harms experienced by the most marginalized human beings across the planet—links the effects of climate change to the world’s most vulnerable people (Pellow, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_801" title="801"></span>2017). On a global level, as we have already seen, soil degradation, deforestation, water shortages, and toxic emissions of all sorts are most heavily concentrated in the global south. Apart from severe droughts, which are turning once-fertile lands into deserts, global warming threatens the water supplies of hundreds of millions of people, increases the danger of flooding for others, adversely affects agriculture in parts of the world, and further reduces the planetary biodiversity on which many depend.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">This alerts us to another aspect of global environmental injustice: the fact that the most toxic industries are located in the poorest nations with the fewest enforced protections for vulnerable workers and communities. If, as Bullard comments, living on the “wrong side of the tracks” in the United States means one is more likely to get the toxic dump, living on the “wrong side of the world” means getting the factory that dumps pollutants into the neighborhood water supply, or pumps them into the air that is breathed by local residents. Bangladesh and Pakistan, two countries where factories make clothing and textile for U.S. and European firms, are among the countries with the worst atmospheric pollution (World Population Review, 2019c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sadly, even efforts to be ecologically responsible in the United States can contribute to environmental injustice in poor countries. In the Indonesian village of Tropodo, a village of 5,000 people that makes much of the tofu that is part of the regional diet, the air is foul with acrid black smoke that results from burning paper and plastic waste, a major fuel in the tofu industrial process. The paper and plastic, in turn, originates with U.S. and other industrial countries’ recycling efforts. Much of this material had previously gone to China for recycling, but in recent years, citing health and environmental concerns, China placed severe restrictions on receiving waste paper, discarded plastic and unwanted metals. Such “foreign garbage” (as China described it) wound up in other, poorer countries in the region, including Indonesia. While most of the recycled plastic was supposed to be repurposed in fleece jackets and athletic shoes, in fact much of it turned out to be unusable or intermixed with paper. Tofu manufacturers prefer burning the paper-plastic mix to burning wood, since it is far cheaper; yet this exacts a significant environmental health toll on the workers and the entire community. Plastic fumes contain a number of toxic substances, including dioxin, a highly toxic chemical that causes cancer, birth defects, and Parkinson’s disease. It also gets into the soil, where it is ingested by local hens and winds up in the eggs that are consumed throughout the village (Ives, 2019; Paddock, 2019; IPEN, 2019).</p>
