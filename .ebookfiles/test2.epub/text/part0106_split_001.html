<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Is Intelligence Shaped by Genes or Environment?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What social or biological factors shape how “intelligent” we are? This question has been at the center of hotly contested debates for nearly five decades. Understanding <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_642" title="642"></span>the sources of IQ is an important goal for educational researchers, because scores on IQ tests correlate highly with academic performance (which is not surprising, given that IQ tests were originally developed to predict success in school). They therefore also correlate closely with social, economic, and ethnic differences because these are associated with variations in levels of educational attainment. Another reason scholars are interested in factors that shape IQ is because answers to this question may help remedy the achievement gap we learned about earlier in this chapter. White students score better, on average, than African Americans or members of other disadvantaged minorities. An article published by Arthur Jensen in 1969 caused a furor by attributing IQ differences between Blacks and Whites in part to genetic variations (see also Jensen, 1979). Most sociologists argue that such attributions are incomplete and misleading.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Later, Richard J. Herrnstein, a psychologist, and Charles Murray, a sociologist, reopened the debate about IQ in a controversial way. They argued in their book <i class="italic">The Bell Curve</i> (1994) that the accumulated evidence linking IQ to genetic inheritance was now overwhelming. The significant differences in intelligence among various racial and ethnic groups, they said, must in part be explained in terms of heredity. According to Herrnstein and Murray, the available evidence strongly indicated that some ethnic groups on average had higher IQs than other groups. Asian Americans, particularly Japanese Americans and Chinese Americans, on average possessed higher IQs than Whites, although the difference was not large. The average IQs of Asians and Whites, however, were substantially higher than those of Blacks. Summarizing the findings of 156 studies, Herrnstein and Murray found an average difference of 16 IQ points between these two racial groups. The authors argued that such differences in inherited intelligence contributed in an important way to social divisions in American society. The smarter an individual is, the greater the chance they will rise in the social scale. Those at the top are there partly because they are smarter than the rest of the population—from which it follows that those at the bottom remain there because, on average, they are not as smart.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Herrnstein and Murray’s claim created a great deal of controversy and raised the ire and indignation of countless liberals, social scientists, and members of the African American community. Although Herrnstein and Murray’s claims may be seen as racist and reprehensible, are these sufficient reasons to attack their work? Or are their conclusions based on faulty social research? The answer to both questions is a resounding yes. A team of sociologists at the University of California at Berkeley later reanalyzed much of the data that Herrnstein and Murray had based their conclusions on and came up with quite different findings.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the original analysis, Herrnstein and Murray analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY), a survey of more than 10,000 young Americans who were interviewed multiple times over a period of more than a decade. As part of this study, subjects were given the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT), a short test that assesses IQ. Herrnstein and Murray then conducted statistical analyses, which used the AFQT score to predict a variety of outcomes. They concluded that having a high IQ was the best predictor of later economic success and that low IQ was the best predictor of poverty later in life. The Berkeley sociologists, in their 1996 book <i class="italic">Inequality by Design</i> (Fischer et al., 1996), countered that the AFQT does not necessarily measure intelligence, but only how much a person has learned in school. Moreover, they found that intelligence is only one factor among several that predicts how well people do in life. Social factors, including education, gender, community conditions, marital <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_643" title="643"></span>status, current economic conditions, and (perhaps most important) parents’ socioeconomic status, better predict one’s occupational and economic success.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the original analysis, Herrnstein and Murray measured parents’ socioeconomic status by taking an average of mother’s education, father’s education, father’s occupation, and family income. The Berkeley sociologists recognized that each of these four factors matters differently in predicting a child’s occupational outcomes and thus weighted the four components differently. Their analysis showed that the effects of socioeconomic background on a young adult’s risk of later poverty were substantially greater than Herrnstein and Murray originally found. The Berkeley sociologists also recognized that IQ is closely associated with one’s level of education. They reanalyzed the NLSY data, taking into consideration the individual’s level of education, and found that Herrnstein and Murray had drastically overestimated the effects of IQ on a person’s later achievements.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The relationship between race and intelligence is also best explained by social rather than biological causes, according to the Berkeley sociologists. All societies have oppressed ethnic groups. Low status, often coupled with discrimination and mistreatment, leads to socioeconomic deprivation, group segregation, and a stigma of inferiority. The combination of these forces often prevents racial minorities from obtaining a quality education, and, consequently, their scores on standardized intelligence tests are lower.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The average lower IQ score of African Americans in the United States is remarkably similar to that of deprived ethnic minorities in other countries—such as the “untouchables” in India (who are at the very bottom of the caste system), the Maori in New Zealand, and the <i class="italic">burakumin</i> of Japan. Children in these groups score an average of 10 to 15 IQ points below children belonging to the ethnic majority. The <i class="italic">burakumin</i>—descendants of people who, in the eighteenth century, as a result of local wars, were dispossessed from their land and became outcasts and vagrants—are a particularly interesting example. They are not in any way physically distinct from other Japanese, although they have suffered from prejudice and discrimination for centuries. In this case, the difference in average IQ results cannot derive from genetic variations because there are no genetic differences between them and the majority population; yet the IQ difference is as thoroughly fixed as that between Blacks and Whites. <i class="italic">Burakumin</i> children in the United States, where they are treated like other Japanese, do as well on IQ tests as other Japanese children.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Such observations strongly suggest that the IQ variations between African Americans and Whites in the United States result from social and cultural differences. This conclusion receives further support from a comparative study of 14 nations (including the United States) showing that average IQ scores have risen substantially over the past half century for the population as a whole (Coleman, 1987). IQ tests are regularly updated. When old and new versions of the tests are given to the same group of people, they score significantly higher on the old tests. Present-day children taking IQ tests from the 1930s outscored 1930s groups by an average of 15 points—just the kind of average difference that currently separates Blacks and Whites. Children today are not innately superior in intelligence to their parents or grandparents; the shift presumably derives from increasing prosperity and social advantages. The average social and economic gap between Whites and African Americans is at least as great as that between the different generations and is sufficient to explain the variation in IQ scores. Although genetic variations between individuals may influence scores on IQ tests, these have no overall connection to racial differences.</p>
