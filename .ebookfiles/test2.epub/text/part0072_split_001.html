<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In your daily life, you have no doubt used the terms <i class="italic">race</i> and <i class="italic">ethnicity</i> many times, but do you know what they mean? In fact, defining these terms is very difficult, not least because of the contradiction between their everyday usage and their scientific basis (or absence thereof).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When the Census Bureau asks people to classify themselves, many respondents mistakenly think that humans can be readily separated into biologically different races. Yet, in biological terms, there are no clear-cut races. We therefore define <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-race" href="part0072_split_003.html#race">race</a> as a socially constructed category rooted in the belief that there are fundamental differences among humans, associated with phenotype and ancestry (Monk, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Differences in physical type between groups of human beings arise from population inbreeding, which varies according to the degree of contact between different cultural or social groups. Human population groups are a continuum. The genetic diversity within populations that share visible physical traits is as great as the diversity between them. Thus, the racial differences the Census Bureau recognizes (Black, White, Hispanic) should be understood as physical variations singled out by the members of a community or society as socially significant and meaningful. Differences in skin color are treated as significant, for example, whereas differences in eye color and height are not. Racial categories are always nationally and historically specific (Fredrickson, 2002), and they can vary significantly from place to place.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some social scientists argue that race is nothing more than an ideological construct whose use in academic circles perpetuates the commonly held belief that it has a basis in reality (Miles, 1993). For this reason, they argue, it should be abandoned. Others disagree, claiming that “race” still has meaning for many people and cannot be ignored. In historical terms, “race” has been an extremely important concept used by powerful social groups as part of strategies of domination (Spencer, 2014). For example, the contemporary situation of African Americans in the United States cannot be understood without reference to the slave trade, racial segregation, and persistent racial ideologies (Wacquant, 2010). Racial distinctions are more than ways of describing differences; they are also important factors in the reproduction of patterns of power and inequality.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Hence, “race” remains a vital, if highly contested, concept, which sociologists have to explore wherever it is in use. For this reason, you sometimes will come across sociological papers and books that put the word “race” in quotation marks to reflect its unscientific, problematic, but still commonplace usage in society.</p>
