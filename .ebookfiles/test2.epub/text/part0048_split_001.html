<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Functionalist theories argue that crime occurs when the aspirations of individuals and groups do not coincide with available opportunities. The disparity between desires and fulfillment will lead to deviant behavior.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Crime and Anomie: Durkheim and Merton</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Émile Durkheim and Robert Merton argued that deviant behavior is the result of the structure of modern societies. Durkheim’s notion of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-anomie" href="part0048_split_006.html#anomie">anomie</a> suggests that in modern societies, traditional norms and standards become undermined without being replaced by new ones. Anomie exists when there are no clear standards to guide behavior in a given area of social life. Under such circumstances, Durkheim believed, people feel disoriented and anxious; anomie therefore heightens dispositions to suicide.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Durkheim saw crime and deviance as inevitable and necessary elements in modern societies. According to Durkheim, people in the modern age are less constrained <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_203" title="203"></span>than they were in traditional societies. Because there is more room for individual choice in the modern world, inevitably there will be some nonconformity. Durkheim recognized that modern society would never be in complete consensus about the norms and values that govern it.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Deviance is also necessary for society, according to Durkheim. First, deviance has an adaptive function: By introducing new ideas and social challenges, deviance brings about change. Second, deviance promotes boundary maintenance between “good” and “bad” behavior. A criminal event can provoke a collective response that heightens group solidarity and clarifies social norms. For example, residents of a neighborhood facing a problem with drug dealers might join together in the aftermath of a drug-related shooting and commit themselves to maintaining the area as a drug-free zone.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Durkheim’s ideas on crime and deviance helped shift attention from explanations that focused on the problems of individuals to explanations focused on social forces. His notion of anomie was applied by the American sociologist Robert K. Merton (1957), who located the source of crime within the very structure of American society.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Merton modified the concept of anomie to refer to the strain put on individuals’ behavior when accepted norms conflict with social reality. In American society—and, to some degree, in other industrial societies—values emphasize material success through self-discipline and hard work. Accordingly, it is believed that people who work hard can succeed regardless of their starting point in life. This idea is not in fact valid because most disadvantaged people have limited or no conventional opportunities for advancement, such as high-quality education. Yet those who do not “succeed” are condemned for their apparent inability to make material progress. In this situation, there is pressure to get ahead by any means, legitimate or illegitimate. According to Merton, then, deviance is a by-product of economic inequalities.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Merton split people into five possible types based on how they responded to the tensions between socially endorsed values and the limited means of achieving them (see Figure 7.2): <i class="italic">Conformists</i> accept generally held values and the conventional means of realizing them, regardless of whether they meet with success. Most of the population falls into this category. <i class="italic">Innovators</i> accept socially approved values but use illegitimate or illegal means to follow them. We might consider members of the Mafia to be innovators. While most Mafia members want to lead respectable lives by entering into mainstream <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_204" title="204"></span>society, they need to acquire wealth through illegal activities to do so (Gladwell, 2014). <i class="italic">Ritualists</i> conform to socially accepted standards, though they have lost sight of their underlying values. They compulsively follow rules for their own sake. A ritualist might dedicate herself to a boring job, even though it has no career prospects and provides few rewards. <i class="italic">Retreatists</i> have abandoned the competitive outlook, rejecting both the dominant values and the approved means of achieving them. An example would be members of a self-supporting commune. Finally, <i class="italic">rebels</i> reject both the existing values and the means of achieving them but work to substitute new ones and reconstruct the social system. The members of radical political and religious groups, such as the Heaven’s Gate cult, fall into this category.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Merton’s writings addressed one of the main puzzles in the study of criminology: At a time when society as a whole was becoming more affluent, why did crime rates continue to rise? By emphasizing the contrast between rising aspirations and persistent inequalities, Merton identified a sense of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-relative-deprivation" href="part0048_split_006.html#relative-deprivation">relative deprivation</a>, or the recognition that one has less than their peers, as an important element in deviant behavior.</p>

<section id="subcultural-explanations">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Subcultural Explanations</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Later researchers examined subcultural groups that adopt norms that encourage or reward criminal behavior. Like Merton, Albert Cohen saw the contradictions within American society as the main cause of crime. But while Merton emphasized individual deviant responses, Cohen saw the responses occurring collectively through subcultures. In <i class="italic">Delinquent Boys</i> (1955), Cohen argues that frustrated boys in the lower working class often join delinquent subcultures, such as gangs. These subcultures reject middle-class values and replace them with norms that celebrate nonconformity and deviance, such as delinquency.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Richard A. Cloward and Lloyd E. Ohlin (1960) agreed with Cohen that most delinquent youths emerge from the lower working class. But they argued that such gangs arise in subcultural communities where the chances of achieving success legitimately are slim, as among deprived ethnic minorities. Cloward and Ohlin’s work emphasized connections between conformity and deviance: Individuals follow rules when they have the opportunity to do so and break rules when they do not. As a result, they develop subcultures with deviant values in response to a lack of legitimate opportunities for success as defined by the wider society. This lack of opportunity is the differentiating factor between those who engage in criminal behavior and those who do not.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Functionalist theories rightly emphasize connections between conformity and deviance in different social contexts. We should be cautious, however, about accepting the idea that people in poorer communities aspire to the same things as more affluent people. Most adjust their aspirations to the reality of their situation. Merton, Cohen, and Cloward and Ohlin can all be criticized for presuming that middle-class values <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_205" title="205"></span>are accepted throughout society. It would also be wrong to suppose that only the less privileged experience a mismatch of aspirations and opportunities. Pressures toward criminal activity exist among other groups, too, as indicated by the white-collar crimes of embezzlement, fraud, and tax evasion, which we will study later.</p>

<figcaption class="figure__caption">Members of an El Salvadoran gang display their tattoos. The gangs, called <i class="italic">maras</i>, began in Los Angeles in the 1980s to protect themselves from established street gangs after their working-class families fled civil war in Central America. How might Cohen, Cloward, and Ohlin explain the emergence of the maras?</figcaption>
