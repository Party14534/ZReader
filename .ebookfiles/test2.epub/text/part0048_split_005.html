<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_5">Theoretical Conclusions</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The contributions of the sociological theories of crime and deviance are twofold. First, these theories correctly emphasize that criminal and “respectable” behavior are not two discrete categories; rather, they are points along a continuum. The contexts in which particular types of activity are seen as criminal and punishable by law vary widely. Second, all agree that context is important; whether someone engages in a criminal act or comes to be regarded as a criminal is influenced by social learning and social surroundings.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In spite of its deficiencies, labeling theory is perhaps the most widely used approach to understanding crime and deviant behavior. It explains how some activities become defined in law as punishable, the power relations that form such definitions, and the circumstances in which particular individuals fall afoul of the law.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The way in which crime is understood directly affects the policies developed to combat it. For example, if crime is seen as the product of deprivation or social disorganization, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_212" title="212"></span>policies might be aimed at reducing poverty and strengthening social services. If criminality is seen as freely chosen, attempts to counter it will take a different form.</p>
