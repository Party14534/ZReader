<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">Saskia Sassen: Global Cities</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Saskia Sassen has been one of the leading contributors to theoretical debates on cities and globalization. She shows how globalization is transforming cities into vital hubs within the global economy. Urban centers have become critical in coordinating information flows, managing business activities, and innovating new services and technologies. As business, production, advertising, and marketing assume a global scale, an enormous amount of organizational activity must be performed to maintain and develop these global networks. Power has been dispersed around the globe, concentrated in what Sassen (1991, 1998) terms <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-global-city" href="part0123_split_005.html#global-city">global cities</a>. These are urban centers that are home to the headquarters of large transnational corporations and a superabundance of financial, technological, and consulting services. In her early work, Sassen (1991) focuses on three such cities: <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_777" title="777"></span>New York, London, and Tokyo. The contemporary development of the world economy, she argued, has created a novel, strategic role for major cities. Most such cities have long been centers of international trade, but they now have four new traits:</p>
<ol class="fmnl">
<li class="bcpt" value="1"><span>They have developed into command posts—centers of direction and policy making—for the global economy.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="2"><span>They are the key locations for financial and specialized service firms, which have become more important than manufacturing in influencing economic development.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="3"><span>They are the sites of production and innovation in these newly expanded industries.</span></li>
<li class="bcpt" value="4"><span>They are markets in which the “products” of financial and service industries are bought, sold, or otherwise disposed of.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Within the highly dispersed world economy of today, cities such as these provide for central control of the specialized services business organizations require for administering offices and factories scattered across the world, and of financial innovations and markets. Services and financial goods are the “things” the global city makes. In the downtown areas of global cities, local firms mingle with national and multinational organizations, including a multiplicity of foreign companies. Global cities compete with one another, but they also constitute an interdependent system, partly separate from the nations in which they are located. Sassen (1998) further argues that global cities have produced a new, interrelated dynamic of inequality: a prosperous central business district interlinked with a nearby impoverished area. The growth sectors of the new economy—financial services, marketing, high technology—are reaping profits far greater than any found within traditional economic sectors. As the salaries and bonuses of the very affluent continue to climb, the wages of those employed to clean and guard their offices are dropping. Sassen argues that we are witnessing the “valorization” of work located at the forefront of the new global economy, along with the “devalorization” of work that occurs behind the scenes. A geography of “centrality and marginality” is taking shape, as Mitch Duneier’s (1999) study in New York’s Greenwich Village revealed. Alongside resplendent affluence there is acute poverty. Yet although these two worlds coexist side by side, the actual contact between them can be <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_778" title="778"></span>surprisingly minimal. As Mike Davis (1990) noted in his study of Los Angeles, there has been a “conscious ‘hardening’ of the city surface against the poor.” Walled compounds, neighborhoods guarded by electronic surveillance, and “corporate citadels” have replaced accessible public spaces.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sassen and others have built on her earlier work, noting that as globalization progresses, more and more cities are joining New York, London, and Tokyo in the ranks of the global cities, with places such as Chicago, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Milan, Osaka, Singapore, and Zurich serving as major global centers for business and financial services. Beneath these, new sets of regional centers are developing as key nodes within the global economy. Cities such as Buenos Aires, Jakarta, Madrid, Moscow, São Paulo, and Seoul are becoming important hubs for activity within the so-called emerging markets.</p>
