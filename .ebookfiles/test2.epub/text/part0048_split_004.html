<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_4">Control Theory</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-control-theory" href="part0048_split_006.html#control-theory">Control theory</a> posits that crime results from an imbalance between impulses toward criminal activity and the social or physical controls that deter it. Control theory assumes that people act rationally and that, given the opportunity, everyone would engage in deviant acts. One of the best-known control theorists, Travis Hirschi, argues that humans are fundamentally selfish beings who make calculated decisions about whether to engage in criminal activity by weighing the benefits and risks. In <i class="italic">Causes of Delinquency</i> (1969), Hirschi identifies four types of bonds that link people to society and law-abiding behavior, thus maintaining social control and conformity: attachment, commitment, involvement, and belief.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Attachment refers to emotional and social ties to persons who accept conventional norms, such as a peer group of students who value good grades and hard work. Commitment refers to the rewards obtained by participating in conventional activities and pursuits. For example, a high school dropout has little to lose by being arrested, whereas a dedicated student may lose his or her chance of going to college. Involvement refers to one’s participation in conventional activities, such as paid employment, school, or community activities. The time spent in conventional activities means time not spent <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_209" title="209"></span>in deviant activities. Finally, beliefs involve holding morals and values that are consistent with conventional tenets of society. For example, people who believe that honesty and hard work are the keys to success may be less likely to resort to theft to get ahead in the world.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">When sufficiently strong, these four elements help to maintain social control and conformity by rendering people unfree to break rules. If these bonds are weak, delinquency and deviance may result. Hirschi’s approach suggests that delinquents have low levels of self-control that result from inadequate socialization at home or at school (Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Some control theorists see the growth of crime as an outcome of the increasing number of opportunities and targets for crime in modern society. As the population grows more affluent and consumerism becomes more central, more people own goods such as televisions, video equipment, computers, cars, and designer clothing—favorite targets for thieves. Residential homes are increasingly empty during the daytime as more women work outside the home. Motivated offenders can select from a broad range of suitable targets.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many official approaches to crime prevention in recent years have focused on limiting the opportunities for crime via target hardening—making it more difficult for criminals to commit crimes by minimizing their opportunities to do so and intervening in potential crime situations. Control theorists argue that rather than changing the criminal, the best policy is to take practical measures to control the criminal’s ability to commit crime by promoting the use of crime-deterring technologies and practices like community policing, private security services, house alarms, and even gated communities.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Target-hardening techniques and zero-tolerance policing have been successful at curtailing crime in some contexts; however, these measures do not address the underlying causes of crime and instead are aimed at protecting and defending certain <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_210" title="210"></span>elements of society from its reach. The growing popularity of private security services, alarm systems, and gated communities suggests that segments of the population feel compelled to defend themselves against others. This tendency is occurring not only in the United States but also in countries such as South Africa, Brazil, and those of the former Soviet Union, where a fortress mentality has emerged among the privileged.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These policies have another unintended consequence: As popular crime targets are “hardened,” patterns of crime may simply shift from one domain to another. Target-hardening and zero-tolerance approaches may simply displace criminal offenses from better-protected areas to more vulnerable ones. Neighborhoods that are poor or lacking in social cohesion may well experience a growth in crime and delinquency as target hardening in affluent regions increases.</p>
<section id="the-theory-of-broken-windows">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">The Theory of Broken Windows</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Target hardening and zero-tolerance policing are based on a theory known as <i class="italic">broken windows</i> (Wilson and Kelling, 1982), which arose from a study by the social psychologist Philip Zimbardo (1969). Zimbardo abandoned cars without license plates and with their hoods up in two social settings: the wealthy community of Palo Alto, California, and a poor neighborhood in the Bronx, New York. In both places, the cars were vandalized once passersby, regardless of class or race, sensed that the vehicles had been abandoned. Extrapolating from this study, Wilson and Kelling argued that any sign of social disorder in a community, even the appearance of a broken window, encourages more serious crime. One unrepaired broken window is a sign that no one cares, so breaking more windows—that is, committing more serious crimes—is a rational response by criminals to this situation of social disorder. Thus, minor acts of deviance lead to a spiral of crime and social decay.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the late 1980s and 1990s, the broken windows theory underpinned policing strategies that aggressively focused on minor crimes such as traffic violations and drinking or using drugs in public. Studies have shown that proactive policing directed at maintaining public order can reduce the occurrence of more serious crimes, such as robbery (Sampson and Cohen, 1988). However, it remains unclear whether the broken windows theory is generalizable to all sorts of crime. Walking in a neighborhood where garbage and rubble are strewn across the sidewalk, we might be more likely to litter, but we might not necessarily be tempted to commit more serious crimes like murder. Lacking a systematic definition of disorder, the police can see almost anything as a sign of disorder and anyone as a threat. In fact, as crime rates fell throughout the 1990s, the number of complaints <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_211" title="211"></span>of police abuse and harassment went up, particularly by young, urban Black men who fit the “profile” of a potential criminal.</p>
