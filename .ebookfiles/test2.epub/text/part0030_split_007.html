<dd role="definition" id="social-self" aria-labelledby="keyterm-social-self" class="calibre11">The basis of self-consciousness in human individuals, according to the theory of G. H. Mead.

<dd role="definition" id="self-consciousness" aria-labelledby="keyterm-self-consciousness" class="calibre11">Awareness of one’s distinct social identity as a person separate from others. Human beings are not born with self-consciousness but acquire an awareness of self as a result of early socialization. The learning of language is of vital importance to the processes by which the child learns to become a self-conscious being.</dd>

<dd role="definition" id="looking-glass-self" aria-labelledby="keyterm-looking-glass-self" class="calibre11">According to Cooley’s theory, the reactions we elicit in social situations create a mirror in which we see ourselves.</dd>

<dd role="definition" id="sensorimotor-stage" aria-labelledby="keyterm-sensorimotor-stage" class="calibre11">According to Jean Piaget, a stage of human cognitive development in which a child’s awareness of his or her environment is dominated by perception and touch.</dd>

<dd role="definition" id="preoperational-stage" aria-labelledby="keyterm-preoperational-stage" class="calibre11">A stage of cognitive development, in Piaget’s theory, in which the child has advanced sufficiently to master basic modes of logical thought.</dd>

<dd role="definition" id="concrete-operational-stage" aria-labelledby="keyterm-concrete-operational-stage" class="calibre11">A stage of cognitive development, as formulated by Piaget, in which the child’s thinking is based primarily on physical perception of the world. In this phase, the child is not yet capable of dealing with abstract concepts or hypothetical situations.</dd>

<dd role="definition" id="formal-operational-stage" aria-labelledby="keyterm-formal-operational-stage" class="calibre11">According to Piaget’s theory, a stage of cognitive development at which the growing child becomes capable of handling abstract concepts and hypothetical situations.</dd>
