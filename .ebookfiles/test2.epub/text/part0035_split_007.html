<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_7">Interaction in Time and Space</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Understanding how activities are distributed in time and space is fundamental to analyzing encounters and understanding social life in general. All interaction is situated—it occurs in a particular place and has a specific duration in time. Our actions over the course of a day tend to be “zoned” in time as well as in space. Thus, for example, most people spend a zone—say, from 9:00 <small class="smallcaps">A.M.</small> to 5:00 <small class="smallcaps">P.M.</small>—of their daily time working. Their weekly time is also zoned: They are likely to work on weekdays and spend weekends at home, altering the pattern of their activities on the weekend days. As they move through the temporal zones of the day, they often are also moving across space; to get to work, they may take a bus from one area of a city to another or perhaps commute from the suburbs. When we analyze the contexts of social interaction, therefore, it is often useful to look at people’s movements across <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-time-space" href="part0035_split_008.html#time-space">time-space</a>.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The concept of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-regionalization" href="part0035_split_008.html#regionalization">regionalization</a> will help us understand how social life is zoned in time-space. Take the example of a private home. A modern house is regionalized into rooms, hallways, and floors (if there is more than one story). These spaces are not just physically separate areas but are zoned in time as well. The living room and kitchen are used mostly in the daylight hours; the bedrooms, at night. The interaction that occurs in these regions is bound by both spatial and temporal divisions. Some areas of the house form <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-back-region" href="part0035_split_008.html#back-region">back regions</a>, with “performances” taking place in <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-front-region" href="part0035_split_008.html#front-region">front regions</a>. At times, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_145" title="145"></span>whole house can become a back region. Once again, this idea is beautifully captured by Goffman (1973):</p>
<blockquote class="calibre13">
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">[On] a Sunday morning, a whole household can use the wall around its domestic establishment to conceal a relaxing slovenliness in dress and civil endeavor, extending to all rooms the informality that is usually restricted to kitchen and bedrooms. So, too, in American middle-class neighborhoods, on afternoons the line between children’s playground and home may be defined as backstage by mothers, who pass along it wearing jeans, loafers, and a minimum of make-up.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Clock Time</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In modern societies, the zoning of our activities is strongly influenced by <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-clock-time" href="part0035_split_008.html#clock-time">clock time</a>. Without clocks and the precise timing of activities, and thereby their coordination across space, industrialized societies could not exist (Mumford, 1973). Today, the measuring of time by clocks is standardized across the globe, making possible the complex international transport systems and communications we now depend on. World standard time was first introduced in 1884 at a conference of nations held in Washington, D.C. The globe was then partitioned into 24 time zones, one hour apart, and an exact beginning of the universal day was fixed.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Fourteenth-century monasteries were the first organizations to try to schedule the activities of their inmates precisely across the day and week. Today, there is virtually no group or organization that does not do so. The greater the number of people and resources involved, the more precise the scheduling must be. Eviatar Zerubavel (1979, 1982) demonstrated this concept in his study of the temporal structure of a large modern hospital. A hospital must operate on a 24-hour basis, and coordinating the staff and resources is a highly complex matter. For instance, the nurses work for one time period in ward A, another time period in ward B, and so on, and are called on to alternate between day- and night-shift work. Nurses, doctors, and other staff, plus the resources they need, must be integrated in both time and space.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Social Life and the Ordering of Space and Time</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Internet is another example of how closely forms of social life are bound up with our control of space and time. The Internet makes it possible for us to interact with people we never see or meet, in any corner of the world. Such technological change rearranges space—we can interact with anyone without moving from our chair. It also alters our experience of time, because electronic communication is almost immediate. Until about 50 years ago, most communication across space required a duration of time. If you sent a letter to someone <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_146" title="146"></span>abroad, there was a time gap while the letter was carried by ship, train, truck, or plane to the person to whom it was written.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">People still write letters by hand today, of course, but instantaneous communication has become basic to our social world. Our lives would be almost unimaginable without it. We are so used to being able to switch on the TV and watch the news, make a phone call, or email a friend in another state or country that it is hard for us to imagine what life would be like otherwise.</p>
