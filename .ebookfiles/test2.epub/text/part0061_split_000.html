<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What causes global inequality? How can it be overcome? In this section, we examine four different theories that have been advanced over the years to explain global inequality: neoliberal theories, dependency theories, world-systems theories, and global capitalism theories. Each approach has strengths and weaknesses. One shortcoming of all four is that they tend to underemphasize the role of women in economic development. By putting the theories together, however, we should be able to answer a question facing the 84 percent of the world’s population living outside high-income countries: How can they move up in the world economy?</p>
