<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">The Effect of Globalization on Our Lives</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although globalization is often associated with changes within big systems—such as world financial markets, production and trade, and telecommunications—its effects are felt equally strongly in the private realm. Inevitably, our personal lives have been altered as globalizing forces enter into our local contexts, our homes, and our <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_837" title="837"></span>communities through impersonal sources—such as the media, the Internet, and popular culture—as well as through personal contact with individuals from other countries and cultures.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As the societies in which we live undergo profound transformations, the institutions that underpin them have become outdated, which is, in turn, forcing a redefinition of the family, gender roles, sexuality, personal identity, our interactions with others, and our relationships to work. The political, economic, social, and technological factors just described are producing a phenomenon without parallel in terms of intensity and scope.</p>
<section id="the-rise-of-individualism">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">The Rise of Individualism</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In the current age, individuals have much more opportunity to shape their own lives than once was the case. At one time, tradition and custom strongly influenced the path of people’s lives. Factors such as social class, gender, ethnicity, and religious affiliation could close off certain avenues for individuals or open up others. The values, lifestyles, and ethics prevailing in one’s community provided fixed guidelines for living.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Conditions of globalization, however, bring a new individualism in which people actively construct their own identities. The weight of tradition and established values is lessening as local communities interact with a new global order. The social codes that formerly guided people’s choices and activities have significantly loosened. Traditional frameworks of identity are dissolving; new patterns of identity are emerging. Globalization is forcing people constantly to respond and adjust to the changing environment; as individuals, we now evolve within the larger context. Even small choices in daily life—what to wear, how to spend leisure time, and how to care for our health and our bodies—are part of an ongoing process of creating and re-creating our self-identities.</p>

<section id="work-patterns">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Work Patterns</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although we may regard work as a chore or a necessary evil, it is undeniably a crucial element in our lives. Not only our jobs but also many other aspects of our existence—from our friends to our leisure pursuits—are shaped by our work patterns.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Globalization has unleashed profound transformations within the world of work. New patterns of international trade and the move to a knowledge economy have significantly altered long-standing employment patterns. Many traditional industries have become obsolete or are losing their share of the market to competitors abroad whose labor costs are lower than in industrialized countries. Global trade and new forms of technology have affected traditional manufacturing communities, where industrial workers have been left unemployed and without the skills required by the knowledge-based economy. These communities are facing new social problems, including long-term unemployment and rising crime rates, as a result of economic globalization.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">If at one time people’s working lives were dominated by employment with one employer over several decades—the so-called job-for-life framework—today, more individuals are creating their own career paths. Often this process involves changing jobs several times over the course of a career, building up new skills and abilities, and transferring them to diverse work contexts. Standard patterns of full-time work are <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_838" title="838"></span>dissolving into more flexible arrangements: working from home via information technology, job sharing, short-term consulting projects, flextime, and so forth (Kalleberg, 2003). While flexibility affords new opportunities for some, for most it means greater uncertainty. Job security and attendant health care and retirement benefits have largely become things of the past.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Women having entered the workforce in large numbers has strongly affected the personal lives of people of both sexes. Expanded professional and educational opportunities have led many women to put off marriage and children until after they have begun a career. Also, many women return to work shortly after having children, instead of remaining at home. These shifts have required important adjustments within families, in terms of the domestic division of labor, the role of men in child-rearing, and the emergence of more family-friendly work policies to accommodate the needs of dual-earner households. Tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Snap, and Netflix all recently expanded their parental leave policies, and as of 2017, IKEA now offers all 13,000 of its employees—men and women, part-time workers and full-time workers—up to four months of paid parental leave.</p>

<section id="popular-culture">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Popular Culture</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The cultural effects of globalization have received much attention. Images, ideas, goods, and styles are now disseminated worldwide more rapidly than ever. Trade, new information technologies, the international media, and global migration have all promoted the free movement of culture across national borders. Many people believe that we now live in a single information order—a massive global network where information is shared quickly and in great volumes. A simple example illustrates this point.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The 2009 film <i class="italic">Avatar</i> is a 3D science-fiction epic in which a greedy Earth-based corporation threatens to destroy a lush forest on the habitable moon Pandora, along with the humanlike Na’vi who live there in peaceful harmony with nature, to obtain the precious mineral called (appropriately) “unobtainium.” <i class="italic">Avatar</i> quickly became the highest-grossing film in history, garnering $2.8 billion at the box office, three-quarters of which came from outside the United States. The film is one of many cultural products that has succeeded in cutting across national boundaries and creating a truly international phenomenon. More recently, films like <i class="italic">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i> and <i class="italic">Wonder Woman</i> have enjoyed worldwide success.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">What accounts for the enormous popularity of a film such as <i class="italic">Avatar</i>? And what does its success tell us about globalization? At one level, <i class="italic">Avatar</i> was popular for straightforward reasons: It combined romance (one of the humans who assumed the bodily shape—avatar—of a Na’vi to infiltrate their community predictably falls in love with a beautiful Na’vi woman) and drama (will the avatar go native and side with the Na’vi? Will the primitive weaponry of the Na’vi triumph over the high-tech weaponry of the humans?). The film was also lavishly produced and included dazzling state-of-the-art special effects.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">But another reason for <i class="italic">Avatar</i>’s popularity is that it reflected ideas and values that resonated with audiences worldwide. One of the film’s central themes is the possibility of romantic love prevailing over vast cultural (indeed, racial) differences and community traditions. Can a human male, even occupying the body of an avatar, truly find <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_839" title="839"></span>love with a 10-foot-tall blue-skinned Na’vi woman? The film, happily in the eyes of its many viewers, shows that true love can indeed conquer all, including a galactic version of racial prejudice and the power of transgalactic corporations that will stop at nothing to satisfy their greed.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">These themes undoubtedly resonated with both widely shared romantic yearnings and growing environmentalist concerns. The success of a film such as <i class="italic">Avatar</i> reflects changing values and may also contribute to this shift in values. Western-made films and television programs, which dominate the global media, advance political, social, and economic agendas that reflect a specifically Western worldview. Some people worry that globalization is fostering a global culture in which the values of the most powerful and affluent—in this instance, Hollywood filmmakers—overwhelm local customs and tradition. According to this view, globalization is a form of cultural imperialism in which Western values, styles, and outlooks smother individual national cultures.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Others, by contrast, have linked globalization to a growing differentiation in cultural traditions and forms, as is seen in the Indian Bollywood and Nigerian Nollywood film industries discussed at the beginning of this chapter. Global society is characterized by an enormous diversity of cultures existing side by side. Local traditions are joined by a host of additional cultural forms from abroad, presenting a bewildering array of lifestyle options. Rather than a unified global culture, what we are witnessing is the fragmentation of cultural forms (Friedman, 1994). Established identities and ways of life grounded in local communities and cultures are giving way to hybrid identities composed of elements from contrasting cultural sources (Hall, 1992). For example, while <i class="italic">bhangra</i> melodies hail from the Punjab region of India, U.S. music fans may recognize bhangra harmonies and rhythms from hip-hop artists such as Beyoncé and Jay-Z. India’s film industry sells twice as many tickets as Hollywood—although revenues from U.S. films eclipse those from Bollywood.</p>
