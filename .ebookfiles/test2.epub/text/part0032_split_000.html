<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although studies of socialization have become quite advanced over the past century, many open or unanswered questions are still the subject of much disagreement among sociologists. Some of the most significant have to do with <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-gender-role-socialization" href="part0032_split_003.html#gender-role-socialization">gender role socialization</a>—the learning of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-gender-roles" href="part0032_split_003.html#gender-roles">gender roles</a> through social factors such as the family and the media.
