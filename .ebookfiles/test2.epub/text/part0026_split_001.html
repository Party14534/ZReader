<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Does Nature or Nurture More Powerfully Influence Human Behavior?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because humans evolved as part of the world of nature, one would assume that human thinking and behavior are the result of biology and evolution. In fact, one of the oldest (and still unresolved) controversies in the social sciences is the “nature/nurture” <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_85" title="85"></span>debate: Are we shaped by our biology, or are we products of learning through life’s experiences—that is, of nurture? Whereas biologists and some psychologists emphasize biological factors, sociologists stress the role of learning and culture. They also argue that because human beings can make conscious choices, neither biology nor culture wholly determines human behavior.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The nature/nurture debate has raged for more than a century. For example, in the 1930s and 1940s, many social scientists focused on biological factors, with some seeking (unsuccessfully) to prove that a person’s physique determined his or her personality. In the 1960s and 1970s, scholars in different fields emphasized culture. Some social psychologists argued that even severe mental illness was the result of society labeling some behavior as unusual rather than the consequence of biochemical processes (Scheff, 1966). Today, partly because of new understandings in genetics and brain neurophysiology, the pendulum is again swinging toward the side of biology.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The resurgence of biological explanations for human behavior began in 1975, when the evolutionary biologist Edward O. Wilson published <i class="italic">Sociobiology: The New Synthesis.</i> The term <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-sociobiology" href="part0026_split_005.html#sociobiology">sociobiology</a> refers to the application of biological principles to explain the social activities of animals, including human beings. Wilson argued that genes influence not only physical traits but also behavior. For instance, some species of animals perform elaborate courtship rituals leading to sexual union and reproduction. Human courtship and sexual behavior, according to sociobiologists, involve similar rituals. Also, in most species, males are larger and more aggressive than females. Some suggest that genetic factors explain why, in all known human societies, men tend to hold positions of greater authority than women.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One way in which sociobiologists illuminate the relations between the sexes is through the idea of “reproductive strategy,” a pattern of behavior developed through evolutionary selection that favors the chances of survival of offspring. The female body has a larger investment in its reproductive cells than the male—a fertilized human egg takes nine months to develop. Thus, women will not squander that investment and are <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_86" title="86"></span>not driven to have sexual relations with many partners; their overriding aim is the care and protection of children. Men, on the other hand, desire to have sex with many partners, which is a sound strategy in terms of preserving the species. This view, it has been suggested, explains differences in sexual behavior and attitudes between men and women.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociobiologists do not argue that genes determine 100 percent of our behavior. For example, depending on the circumstances, men can choose to act in nonaggressive ways. Yet, even though this argument seems to add culture as another explanatory factor in describing human behavior, social scientists have condemned sociobiology for claiming that a propensity for particular behaviors, such as violence, is somehow “genetically programmed” (Seville Statement on Violence, 1990).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Different biological factors interact with, and respond to, environmental inputs. It has been difficult to find compelling, substantive data on the interaction between biology and experience. But more evidence is coming out of studies of brain development. Beginning in the womb, genes interact with hormones to shape the child’s development (Stiles, 2011).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Most sociologists today acknowledge a role for nature in determining attitudes and behavior, but with strong qualifications. For example, no one questions that newborn babies have basic human reflexes, such as “rooting” for the mother’s nipple and responding to the human face (Cosmides and Tooby, 1997; Johnson and Morton, 1991). But it is a leap to conclude that because babies have human reflexes, adult behavior is governed by <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-instincts" href="part0026_split_005.html#instincts">instincts</a>—biologically fixed patterns of action found in all cultures.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists now ask how nature and nurture interact to produce human behavior. They acknowledge that all known human cultures have some common characteristics—for example, language, forms of emotional expression, rules for raising children or engaging in sexual behavior, and standards of beauty (Brown, 1991). But they also recognize that there is enormous variety in <i class="italic">how</i> these common characteristics play out: It is not some biological disposition that makes American men feel attracted to a <i class="italic">particular</i> type of woman. Rather, it’s their exposure to magazine ads, TV commercials, and movies that transmit culturally specific standards of female beauty.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Because humans think and act in many different ways, sociologists do not believe that “biology is destiny.” If biology were all-important, we would expect all cultures to be similar, if not identical. Yet this is hardly the case. For example, pork is forbidden to religious Jews and Muslims, but it is a dietary staple in China. All cultures have standards of beauty and ornamentation, but what constitutes beauty in one culture may constitute the opposite in another (Elias, 1987; Elias and Dunning, 1987; Foucault, 1988). However, some feminist scholars have argued that with global access to Western images of beauty on the Internet, cultural definitions of beauty throughout the world are growing narrower and increasingly emphasize the slender physique that is so cherished in many Western cultures (Sepúlveda and Calado, 2012).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In 2008, a special issue of the <i class="italic">American Journal of Sociology</i> was dedicated to the nature/nurture debate, specifically the relationship between genetics and social influences on human behavior (Bearman, 2008). The studies generally concluded that while genetics are important, how genes might affect behavior depends largely on the social context. For example, a study of obesity among adolescents found that social and behavioral factors, such as a family’s lifestyle (for example, how much time a family <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_87" title="87"></span>spends watching TV or how often a family skips meals), have a significant effect on the likelihood that children will end up overweight, even when both parents are heavy (Martin, 2008). Similarly, an international study of gender differences in mathematical ability found that such differences varied widely across countries, with differences in high mathematical performance between men and women reflecting the country’s level of gender inequality rather than purely biological factors (Penner, 2008). Even alcoholism is strongly affected by social context: While a specific gene has been identified as increasing one’s propensity for alcohol dependence, a strong family support system can greatly reduce that risk (Pescosolido et al., 2008).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists’ main concern, therefore, is with how behavior is learned through interactions with family, friends, schools, television, and every other facet of the social environment. Early child rearing is especially relevant to this kind of learning. Human babies have a large brain, requiring birth relatively early in their fetal development, while their heads can still pass through the birth canal. As a result, human babies must spend a number of years in the care of adults, during which time the child learns his or her society’s culture. All cultures therefore provide for childhood socialization, but the processes vary greatly from culture to culture. An American child learns the multiplication table from a classroom teacher, whereas a child in the forests of Borneo learns to hunt with older members of the tribe.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Perhaps recent scientific advances in brain neurophysiology and genetics will tip the balance more toward emphasizing the role of nature in shaping human behavior. But for the present, most sociologists would conclude that both nature and nurture interact in complex and as yet imperfectly understood ways to shape who we are and how we behave.</p>
