<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Why has racism flourished? There are several reasons. The first reason lies in the exploitative relations that Europeans established with the peoples they conquered. The slave trade could not have persisted had Europeans not constructed a belief system that allowed them to justify their actions by claiming that Africans belonged to an inferior race. Racism helped justify colonial rule over non-Whites and denied them the rights of political participation being won by Whites in the colonists’ European homelands. The relations between Whites and non-Whites varied according to different patterns of colonial settlement and were influenced by cultural differences among Europeans themselves.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Second, an opposition between the colors White and Black as cultural symbols was deeply rooted in European culture. White had long been associated with purity and Black with evil. (There is nothing natural about this symbolism; in some other cultures, it is reversed.) The symbol of Blackness held negative meanings <i class="italic">before</i> the West came into extensive contact with Black peoples. These symbolic meanings influenced the Europeans’ reactions to Blacks when they first encountered them on African shores. The sense that there was a radical difference between Black and White peoples, combined with the “heathenism” of the Africans, led many Europeans to regard Blacks with disdain and fear.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A third factor was the invention and diffusion of the concept of race itself. Racist attitudes have existed for thousands of years. In China in 300 <small class="smallcaps">B.C.E.,</small> for example, we find descriptions of barbarian peoples “who greatly resemble monkeys from whom they are descended.” But the notion of race as a cluster of inherited characteristics comes from European thought. Count Joseph Arthur de Gobineau (1816–1882), sometimes called the father of modern racism, proposed that three races exist: White, Black, and yellow. The White race possessed <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_392" title="392"></span>superior intelligence, morality, and willpower, and these inherited qualities underlay the spread of Western influence across the world. Blacks were the least capable, marked by an animal nature, a lack of morality, and emotional instability.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The ideas of Gobineau and other similar views were presented as supposedly scientific theories. Although completely without factual value, the notion of the superiority of the White race remains a key element of White racism—in the ideology of the Ku Klux Klan, for example—and was the basis of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-apartheid" href="part0074_split_007.html#apartheid">apartheid</a> in South Africa.</p>
