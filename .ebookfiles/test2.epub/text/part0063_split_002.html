<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Is Global Poverty Increasing or Decreasing?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Before we turn to the question of whether global poverty is increasing or decreasing, let’s first consider a different question: Who are the global poor? The World Bank defines extreme poverty as those living on less than $1.90 a day. Four out of five of the world’s poor live in rural areas; nearly two-thirds work in agriculture. Roughly two out of five are 14 or younger and lack formal education. About half (51 percent) of the global poor live in sub-Saharan Africa, while a third live in South Asia (World Bank, 2016b).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The number of people living in extreme poverty is declining. According to the World Bank, 734 million people lived in extreme poverty in 2015, about 10 percent of the world population; in 1993, the number was nearly two and a half times that amount, 1.8 billion people or roughly 34 percent of the world population at that time. This means that since 1993, more than 1.1 billion people have escaped extreme poverty (World Bank, 2019d). But these positive trends mask some disturbing differences between regions and countries (see Figure 9.2). Sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest region in the world, did experience a slight decline in the percentage living in extreme poverty, from 47 percent in 2010 to 42 percent in 2015. Because of overall population growth, however, the number of extremely poor people actually increased, from 394 million to 408 million during the same period (World Bank, 2020b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In fact, a good part of the global reduction in extreme poverty can be attributed to a single region: East Asia and the Pacific. The dynamic economic growth of that region has reduced its extreme poverty rate from 81 percent in 1981 to 2 percent in 2015. And within that region, because of its giant size, China alone has accounted for the lion’s share of the global reduction in number of extremely poor people. Between 1981 and 2015 (the most recent year for which the World Bank has Chinese poverty data), the number of Chinese subsisting on less than $1.90 a day declined from 800 million to 10 million (World Bank, 2019d). China’s economic boom has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty in the past 30 or so years—roughly the same number as for the world as a whole, where declines in extreme poverty in East Asia, Europe, and Latin America have been more than offset by increases in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia.</p>
