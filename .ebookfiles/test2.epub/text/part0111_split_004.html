<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Substantial socioeconomic and regional differences exist among the principal religious groupings in the United States. Liberal Protestants are well educated, somewhat upper income, and middle or upper class. Ethnically, they comprise White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs) of British or German origins. Moderate Protestants have a lower level of education, income, and social class. In fact, they are typical of the national average on these measures. Moderate Protestants are from a variety of European ethnic backgrounds, including British, German, Scandinavian, Irish, and Dutch. Black Protestants are the least educated and poorest of any of the religious groups listed. Conservative Protestants have a similar profile, although they are at a slightly higher level on all these measures. They comprise a diverse profile of European ethnicities, although some are African American as well. Nearly half of all Protestants live in the South (Pew Research Center, 2015g).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Catholics strongly resemble moderate Protestants in terms of their socioeconomic profile. The largest ethnic group is European in origin (primarily German, Italian, Slavic, and Irish, and, to a lesser extent, English and French), followed by Latinos from Mexico and Central and South America. Catholics are pretty evenly distributed across the United States, though we are witnessing a shift from the Northeast and Midwest to the South and West (Pew Research Center, 2015c).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Jews have the highest socioeconomic profile. Most are college graduates in middle- or upper-income categories. One study found that Jewish educational and occupational attainment was significantly higher than that of other Whites. Jews are largely European in origin, particularly Eastern European and German, although some are from northern Africa. Whereas the large majority of Jews once lived in the Northeast, today, less than half do. One recent study suggests that their high degree of geographical mobility is associated with lowered involvement in Jewish institutions. Jews who move throughout the country are less likely to belong to synagogues or temples, have Jewish friends, or be married to Jewish spouses (Goldstein and Goldstein, 1996; Hartman and Hartman, 1996; Pew Research Center, 2008; Roof and McKinney, 1990).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In sum, Jews and liberal Protestants are the most heavily middle and upper class; moderate Protestants and Catholics are somewhat in the middle (although the growing number of poor Catholic Latino immigrants may be changing this position); conservative and Black Protestants are overwhelmingly lower class. These groupings correspond roughly with social and political liberalism and conservatism as well. In terms of civil liberties, racial justice, and womenâ€™s rights, Jews are, by far, the most tolerant. Liberal Protestants and Catholics are somewhat more tolerant than the average American, while moderate Protestants and Black Protestants are somewhat less tolerant. Conservative Protestants are the least tolerant of all religious groupings (Roof and McKinney, 1990). For example, according to a 2015 poll put on by the Pew Research Center, while three-quarters of Jews strongly favor same-sex marriage, the same is true of less than half (45 percent) of all Christians and drops to just a quarter (28 percent) of evangelical Protestants (Pew Research Center, 2015c).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are political differences across religious groups as well. Jews are the most heavily Democratic; fundamentalist and evangelical Christians, the most Republican. The more moderate Protestant denominations are somewhere in between (Kosmin, Mayer, and Keysar, 2001).</p>
