<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">How Can Ethnic Conflict Be Reduced?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The most extreme and devastating form of group relations involves <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-genocide" href="part0075_split_004.html#genocide">genocide</a>—the systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group. The most horrific recent instance of brutal destruction of such a group was the massacre of 6 million Jews in the German concentration camps during World War II. Other examples of mass genocide in the twentieth century span the globe. Between 1915 and 1923, more than a million Armenians were killed by the Ottoman Turkish government. In the late 1970s, 2 million Cambodians died under the Khmer Rouge. During the 1990s, in the African country of Rwanda, hundreds of thousands of the minority Tutsi were massacred by the dominant Hutu group. In the former Yugoslavia, Bosnian and Kosovar Muslims were executed by the Serb majority. And in the Darfur region of Sudan, the conflict between the Arabic-speaking, nomadic Janjaweed and the non-Arab Sudanese who speak African languages escalated to genocide, with hundreds of thousands of people killed and approximately 2 million forced to flee their homes.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia involved <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-ethnic-cleansing" href="part0075_split_004.html#ethnic-cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a>—the creation of ethnically homogeneous areas through the mass expulsion of other ethnic populations via targeted violence, harassment, threats, and campaigns of terror. Croatia, for example, became a “monoethnic” state after a costly war in which thousands of Serbs were expelled from the country. The war—which broke out in Bosnia in 1992 between Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats, and Bosnian Muslims—involved the ethnic cleansing of the Bosnian Muslim population at the hands of the Serbs. Thousands of Muslim men were forced into internment camps, and Muslim women were systematically raped. The war in Kosovo in 1999 was prompted by charges that Serbian forces were ethnically cleansing the Kosovar Albanian (Muslim) population from the province.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In Bosnia and Kosovo, ethnic conflict became internationalized. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled to neighboring areas, further destabilizing the region. Western states intervened diplomatically and militarily to protect the human rights of targeted ethnic groups. In the short term, such interventions succeeded, yet they had unintended consequences as well. The fragile peace in Bosnia has persisted only through the presence of peacekeeping troops and the partitioning of the country into separate ethnic enclaves. In Kosovo, reverse ethnic cleansing ensued after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) bombing campaign. Ethnic Albanian Kosovars began to drive the local Serb population out of Kosovo; the presence of NATO-led Kosovo Force troops was inadequate to prevent ethnic tensions from reigniting.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Violent conflicts worldwide are increasingly civil wars with ethnic dimensions. In a world of growing interdependence and competition, international factors become even <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_412" title="412"></span>more important in shaping ethnic relations, while the effects of internal ethnic conflicts are felt well outside national borders—sometimes provoking military intervention and sometimes requiring international war crimes tribunals. Responding to and preventing ethnic conflicts have become key challenges facing individual states and international political structures.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In some areas of the world, the concept of group closure has been institutionalized in the form of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-segregation" href="part0075_split_004.html#segregation">segregation</a>—a practice whereby racial and ethnic groups are kept physically separate by law, thereby maintaining the superior position of the dominant group. For instance, in apartheid-era South Africa, laws forced Blacks to live separately from Whites and forbade sexual relations between races. In the United States, African Americans experienced numerous legal forms of segregation, including, until 1967, the prohibition of interracial marriage, which had been criminalized for more than 270 years in every state except Alaska and Hawaii. Even today, segregated residential areas still exist in many cities, leading some to claim that an American system of apartheid has developed (Massey and Denton, 1993).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Conflict and Economic Power</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Many commentators have argued that the best way to reduce ethnic conflicts is to establish democracy and a free market; this would promote peace by giving everyone a say in running the country and giving all people access to the prosperity that comes from trade. In <i class="italic">World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability</i> (2003), Amy Chua, a professor at Yale University, contests this view.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Chua’s starting point is that in many developing countries, a small ethnic minority enjoys disproportionate economic power. One example is the White minority that exploited non-White ethnic groups in apartheid South Africa. Chua argues that the massacre of Tutsi by Hutu in Rwanda in 1994 and the hatred felt by Serbs toward Croats in the former Yugoslavia were partly related to the economic advantage enjoyed by the Tutsi and the Croats in their respective countries.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Chua often mentions the Chinese ethnic minority in Indonesia, where the free-market policies of the former dictator General Suharto enriched the country’s tiny Chinese minority. In turn, Chinese Indonesians supported the Suharto dictatorship. By 1998, the year that mass pro-democracy demonstrations forced Suharto to resign, Chinese Indonesians controlled 70 percent of Indonesia’s private economy but made up just 3 percent of its population. The end of Suharto’s regime was accompanied by violent attacks against the Chinese minority. Chua (2003) writes, “The prevailing view among the pribumi [ethnic] majority was that it was ‘worthwhile to lose 10 years of growth to get rid of the Chinese problem once and for all.’”</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">As Suharto’s dictatorship collapsed, the United States and other Western countries called for the introduction of democratic elections. Yet Chua argues that introducing democracy to countries with what she calls “market dominant minorities,” such as the Chinese in Indonesia, is not likely to bring peace but, instead, a backlash from <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_413" title="413"></span>the country’s ethnic majority. Political leaders will emerge who scapegoat the resented minority and encourage the ethnic majority to reclaim the country’s wealth for the “true” owners of the nation, as the pribumi majority in Indonesia did against the Chinese minority.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Chua’s account illustrates that although democracy and the market economy are in principle beneficent forces, they must be grounded in an effective system of law and civil society. Where they are not, new and acute ethnic conflicts can emerge.</p>
