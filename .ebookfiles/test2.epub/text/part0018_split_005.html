<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-comparative-research" href="part0018_split_007.html#comparative-research">Comparative research</a> is of central importance in sociology because it enables researchers to document whether social behavior varies across time and place and by one’s social group membership. Most comparative work is quantitative in that researchers aim to document whether behaviors and attitudes change over time and place; thus, a consistent metric is required to make comparisons. Consider the American rate of divorce—the number of divorces per thousand married people. Divorce rates rose rapidly in the United States after World War II, reaching a peak in 1979. Since then, the divorce rate has dropped by nearly a quarter, with only 15.7 marriages per 1,000 ending in divorce in 2018 (Allred, 2019)—a statistic expressing profound changes in the area of sexual relations and family life. Do these changes reflect specific features of American society? We can find out by comparing divorce rates in the United States with those in other countries. The comparison reveals that although the U.S. rate is higher than the rate in most other Western societies, the overall trends are similar.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The most influential way of doing comparative research is through historical research. One classic study that investigated a much longer period and applied comparative research in a historical context was Theda Skocpol’s <i class="italic">States and Social Revolutions</i> (1979), one of the best-known studies of social change. To produce a theory of the origins and nature of revolution grounded in detailed empirical study, Skocpol looked at processes of revolution in three historical contexts: the 1789 revolution in France, the 1917 revolution in Russia (which brought the Communists to power and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_47" title="47"></span>established the Soviet Union, which was eventually dissolved in 1989), and the revolution of 1949 in China (which created Communist China).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">By analyzing a variety of documentary sources, Skocpol was able to develop a powerful explanation of revolutionary change, one that emphasized underlying social structural conditions. She showed that social revolutions are largely the result of unintended consequences. Before the Russian Revolution, for instance, various political groups were trying to overthrow the regime, but none of these groups—including the Bolsheviks (Communists), who eventually came to power—anticipated the revolution that occurred. A series of clashes and confrontations gave rise to a process of social transformation that was much more radical than anyone had foreseen. At the time that Skocpol wrote, existing theories basically related the emergence of revolutions to the strength of social movements, and these to class relations. Skocpol showed, first, that state structures are as important as class relations and more important than the strength of the revolutionary movements; and second, that these state structures are heavily influenced by international events (for instance, revolutions come in the wake of a breakdown in state authority often due to lost international wars).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">A Recent Example of Comparative Research</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Such studies as those pioneered by Theda Skocpol rely on qualitative methods of historical research, which depend on careful comparisons of a small number of cases. One of the costs of such approaches has been that sociologists have derived their understandings from some very famous revolutions or wars, while ignoring most of the world altogether.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In recent years, Andreas Wimmer has taken up an alternative approach to historical sociology. He uses formal modeling and statistical techniques to analyze hundreds of cases at the same time, rather than a few famous ones. Unlike scholars who go to the library and pull existing data off the shelf, Wimmer has found it necessary to create his own datasets to answer age-old questions. In his approach, what happened in Haiti or in Latin America counts no less than what went on in Holland or in Europe more generally—though these latter places have tended to be studied much more frequently and thus count more heavily in existing theories. Wimmer’s work therefore goes against the grain of most historical sociology that tends to focus mainly on Europe at the expense of Africa and the Americas. (It is not just Latin America that has figured infrequently in historical sociology; even North America is eclipsed by the usual focus on Europe.)</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In his monumental book <i class="italic">Waves of War</i> (2012), Wimmer used this approach to study war as a sociological phenomenon, drawing on large original datasets. He found that if we look at all wars that occurred throughout history, a major shift has occurred. Prior to the nineteenth century, most wars were driven by conquest, or the desire of states to achieve or throw off a certain <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_48" title="48"></span>balance of power in their region. More recently, wars have been driven by ethnic and nationalist concerns. According to Wimmer, whereas Karl Marx once proclaimed that the twentieth century would be the age of revolutionary class struggle, it turned into the age of ethno-nationalist conflict. Using a global dataset of his own creation, Wimmer found that the existence of nationalist organizations in a territory more than doubles the probability of war at any time. It is unlikely that a researcher using a qualitative approach with small numbers of cases would have come up with such a finding, because such an approach would have focused on positive cases (i.e., on a handful of nationalist wars), rather than systematically comparing a large number of pre-nationalist contexts with nationalist ones.</p>
