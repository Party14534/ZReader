<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are cultural differences in the definition of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-personal-space" href="part0036_split_004.html#personal-space">personal space</a>. In Western culture, people usually maintain a distance of at least three feet when engaged in focused interaction with others; when standing side by side, they may stand closer together. In the Middle East, people often stand closer to each other than is thought acceptable in the West. Westerners visiting that part of the world are likely to find themselves disconcerted by this unexpected physical proximity.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Edward T. Hall (1969, 1973), who worked extensively on nonverbal communication, distinguishes four zones of personal space. Intimate distance, of up to one and a half feet, is reserved for very few social contacts. Only those involved in relationships in which regular bodily touching is permitted, such as lovers or parents and children, operate within this zone of private space. Personal distance, from one and a half to four feet, is the normal spacing for encounters with friends and close acquaintances. Some intimacy of contact is permitted, but this tends to be strictly limited. Social distance, from 4 to 12 feet, is the zone usually maintained in formal settings such as interviews. The fourth zone is that of public distance, beyond 12 feet, preserved by those who are performing to an audience.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In ordinary interaction, the most fraught zones are those of intimate and personal distance. If these zones are invaded, people try to recapture their space. We may stare at the intruder as if to say, “Move away!” or elbow him or her aside. When people are forced into proximity closer than they deem desirable, they might create a kind of physical boundary: A reader at a crowded library desk might physically demarcate a private space by stacking books around its edges (Hall, 1969, 1973).</p>
