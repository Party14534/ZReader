<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_3">Types of Religious Organizations</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Early theorists such as Max Weber (1963; orig. 1922), Ernst Troeltsch (1931), and Richard Niebuhr (1929) described religious organizations according to the degree to which they were well established and conventional: In their view, churches are conventional and well established, cults are neither, and sects fall somewhere in the middle. These distinctions were based on a study of European and U.S. religions. There is much debate over how well they apply to the non-Christian world.</p>
<section id="churches-and-sects">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Churches and Sects</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-churches" href="part0109_split_004.html#churches">Churches</a> are large, established religious bodies; one example is the Roman Catholic Church. They normally have a formal, bureaucratic structure with a hierarchy of officials. Churches often represent the conservative face of religion, because they are integrated within the existing institutional order. Most of their adherents are born into, and grow up within, the church.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-sects" href="part0109_split_004.html#sects">sect</a> is typically described as a religious subgroup that breaks away from the larger organization and consequently follows its own unique set of rules and principles. Sects are smaller, less organized groups of committed believers, usually set up in protest of an established church. Sects aim to discover or follow the “true way” and try to either change the surrounding society or withdraw into communities of their own, a process known as <i class="italic">revival.</i> The members of sects often regard established churches as corrupt. Many sects have few or no officials, and all members are equal participants. For the most part, people are not born into sects but join them to further personal beliefs.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Denominations</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-denomination" href="part0109_split_004.html#denomination">denomination</a> is a sect that has become an institutionalized body rather than an activist protest group. Sects that survive over time become denominations. Calvinism, Methodism, and Mormonism were sects during their early period, when they generated great fervor among their members; but, over the years, they became established denominations. (Calvinists today are called Presbyterians.) Denominations are recognized as legitimate by churches, often cooperating harmoniously with them. Other examples of Christian denominations include Baptists, Lutherans, and many of the evangelical Christian groups that have gained adherents and become more mainstream during recent decades.</p>

<section id="cults-section">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_3">Cults</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-cults" href="part0109_split_004.html#cults">Cults</a> resemble sects, but their emphases are different. The most loosely knit and transient of all religious organizations, cults comprise individuals who reject the values of the outside society. They are a form of religious innovation rather than revival. Their focus is on individual experience, bringing like-minded people together. Cults often form around the influence of an inspirational leader.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Cults are often in a high degree of tension with the larger society. In 1997, 39 members of Heaven’s Gate, a cult whose members believed they were destined for a “higher level,” took their lives to ascend to a spaceship they believed lurked behind the Hale-Bopp Comet. The Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo (“Om Supreme Truth”), which once claimed as many as 20,000 members, combined elements of Buddhism and Christianity, including Christian predictions about a pending global apocalypse derived from the Book of Revelations and the writings of the sixteenth-century Christian Nostradamus. (Such doomsday predictions are not uncommon in Christian cults as well.) Aum Shinrikyo’s members regarded the group’s founder and leader, Shoko Asahara, as Christ. In 1995, cult members released the deadly nerve gas sarin on five Tokyo subway trains; 12 people died and thousands were injured, some seriously. Investigations revealed that the cult had previously spread germs at numerous locations in Japan, although without any toxic effects. A large number of the cult members were subsequently tried and convicted in Japan for the subway gassing and other crimes; some, including Asahara, were sentenced to death. In 2000, Aum Shinrikyo changed its name to Aleph, reportedly moderated its teachings, and now claims 1,000 or so members (Juergensmeyer, 2008).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Like sects, cults flourish when there is a breakdown in well-established societal belief systems. This breakdown is happening worldwide today, in places as diverse as Japan, India, and the United States. When such a breakdown occurs, cults may either originate within the society itself or be “imported” from outside. In the United States, examples of homegrown, or indigenous, cults include New Age religions based on spiritualism, astrology, and religious practices adapted from Asian or Native American cultures. Examples of imported cults include the Reverend Sun Myung Moon’s Unification Church (whose members are popularly, if derogatively, known <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_660" title="660"></span>as “Moonies”), which originated in South Korea, and the Transcendental Meditation movement, which was promoted by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India. A cult arising out of the Siddha Yoga tradition was brought to the United States in the 1970s by Swami Muktananda; since his death in 1982, the global spiritual movement—it has centers in nearly three dozen countries—has been led by his female disciple Gurumayi Chidvilasananda.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">A cult in one country may be an established religious practice in another. When Indian gurus practice in the United States, what might be considered an established religion in India is regarded as a cult in the United States. Christianity began as an indigenous cult in ancient Jerusalem, and in many Asian countries today, evangelical Protestantism is regarded as a cult imported from the United States. A leading sociologist of religion, Jeffrey K. Hadden (1997a), points out that all the approximately 100,000 religions that humans have devised were once new; most were initially despised cults from the standpoint of respectable religious belief of the times. For example, Jesus was crucified because his ideas threatened the established order of the Roman-dominated religious establishment of ancient Judaea.</p>
