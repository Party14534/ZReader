<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Dependency Theories</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">During the 1960s, a number of sociologists and economists from the low-income countries of Latin America and Africa rejected Rostow’s argument that their countries’ <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_298" title="298"></span>economic poverty was due to their own cultural or institutional faults (Appelbaum, 2017). Instead, building on the theories of Karl Marx, they argued that contrary to Rostow and other neoliberal economists, capitalism was the problem, not the solution. In their view, global capitalist economic relations had made poor countries dependent on rich countries, locking them in a downward spiral of exploitation and poverty (hence the term <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-dependency-theories" href="part0061_split_006.html#dependency-theories">dependency theory</a>). To better understand how such exploitative relations worked, dependency theory introduced new concepts that emphasized the relational nature of powerful rich countries and relatively powerless poor countries (recall that modernization theory placed the blame for poverty on the poor countries themselves). According to dependency theory, the most advanced industrial countries are best understood as being <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-core" href="part0061_split_006.html#core">core</a> in the world economy, in that they extract the lion’s share of profits from weaker countries; the low-income, largely agricultural countries are best understood as comprising a global economic <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-periphery" href="part0061_split_006.html#periphery">periphery</a>, in that they have a marginal role in the world economy and are thus dependent on the core countries for their trading relationships. The advanced industrial core countries (for example, the United States, Japan, and the countries of Western Europe) extract wealth, in the form of cheap labor and natural resources, from the poorer (and weaker) peripheral countries. In the view of dependency theory, this becomes a vicious downward cycle, in which the core countries in the world economy become richer, while the peripheral countries become increasingly impoverished.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Such exploitative core-periphery relations became a major force with <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-colonialism" href="part0061_split_006.html#colonialism">colonialism</a>, which dates back centuries but achieved its high point in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Powerful nations colonized other countries to procure raw materials (such as petroleum, copper, and iron) for their factories and to control markets for the manufactured products. Although colonialism typically involved European countries establishing colonies in North and South America, Africa, and Asia, some Asian countries (such as Japan) had colonies as well.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Even though colonialism largely ended after World War II, the exploitation did not: Corporations based in high-income countries continued to reap enormous profits from their branches in low-income countries. According to dependency theories, these global companies, often with the support of the powerful banks and governments of rich countries, established factories in poor countries, using cheap labor and raw materials to maximize production costs without governmental interference. In turn, the low prices for labor and raw materials prevented poor countries from accumulating the profit <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_299" title="299"></span>necessary to industrialize themselves. Local businesses that might have competed with foreign corporations were prevented from doing so. In this view, poor countries were forced to borrow from rich countries, thereby increasing their economic dependency.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Low-income countries are thus seen not as underdeveloped but as <i class="italic">misdeveloped</i> (Amin, 1974; Emmanuel, 1972; Frank, 1966, 1969a, 1969b, 1979; Prebisch, 1967, 1971). Except for a few local politicians and businesspeople serving the interests of the foreign corporations, people fall into poverty. Peasants must choose between starvation and working at near-starvation wages on foreign-controlled plantations and in foreign-controlled mines and factories. Dependency theorists rejected such exploitation, and some called for revolutionary changes that would push foreign corporations out of these countries altogether (Frank, 1966, 1969a, 1969b).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Whereas neoliberal theorists usually ignored political and military power, dependency theorists regarded the exercise of power as central to enforcing unequal economic relationships. Whenever local leaders questioned such unequal arrangements, their voices were suppressed. Unionization was usually outlawed, and labor organizers were jailed or killed. When people elected a government opposing these policies, it was likely to be overthrown by the country’s military, often backed by armed forces of the industrialized countries. Dependency theorists cited many examples, such as the role of the CIA in overthrowing the Marxist governments of Guatemala in 1954 and the socialist government in Chile in 1973, and in undermining support for the leftist government in Nicaragua in the 1980s. In the view of dependency theory, global economic inequality was ultimately backed up by force: Economic elites in poor countries, backed by their counterparts in wealthy ones, used police and military power to keep the local population under control.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The Brazilian sociologist Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who served as Brazil’s president from 1995 to 2002, argued that ending dependency did not always require revolutionary changes, as dependency theorists tended to argue. Rather, he claimed, some degree of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-dependent-development" href="part0061_split_006.html#dependent-development">dependent development</a> was possible—that under certain circumstances, dependent countries can still develop economically, although only in ways shaped by their reliance on wealthier countries (Cardoso and Faletto, 1979). In particular, the governments of these countries could help steer a course between dependency and development (Evans, 1979). The rise of the East Asian economies was a case in point: Although Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea were the targets of investments from core countries such as the United States, thanks to strong governments and generally favorable world economic conditions, they eventually emerged from peripheral status and achieved significant economic development during the 1980s <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_300" title="300"></span>and 1990s (Amsden, Kochanowicz, and Taylor, 1994; Appelbaum and Henderson, 1992; Cumings, 1997; Evans, 1995; World Bank, 1997).</p>
