<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Do Older Americans Get an Unfair Amount of Government Support?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The costs of providing for older adults come largely out of taxes paid by working people. In the United States, the growing ratio of older adults to the working-age population has alarmed policy makers. They point out that for every 100 people of working age (20 to 64 years old) there are roughly 25 persons 65 and older; this figure will increase to 38 by 2050. A rapidly aging population will <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_444" title="444"></span>pose serious challenges to public policy throughout this century (He, Goodkind, and Kowal, 2016).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Do government programs adequately promote <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-generational-equity" href="part0081_split_004.html#generational-equity">generational equity</a>—the striking of a balance between the needs and interests of members of different generations? The issue of generational equity was first raised by an organization called Americans for Generational Equity (AGE), created in 1984 by David Durenberger, a U.S. senator from Minnesota, to challenge the notion that older adults are entitled to Social Security benefits (Quadagno, 1989).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">AGE argued that as the U.S. population ages, those who are working will bear an increasing burden for those who are not. AGE also argued that Social Security unfairly favors retirees over other needy groups in society. For example, AGE pointed out that retirees are sometimes wealthier than the working people whose taxes fund Social Security. To illustrate, in 2015, 17.5 percent of persons under age 18 (12.8 million) and 11.2 percent of adults age 18 to 64 (24.2 million) lived at or below the poverty line, while less than 9.2 percent of persons age 65 and older (4.7 million) did so (Fontenot, Semega, and Kollar, 2018). The difficulty arises from the fact that there are fewer and fewer working-age people to shoulder the tax burden necessary to support more and more retirees.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In practice, however, there is limited evidence that the average American is concerned about generational equity and the potential threat of older adults disproportionately benefiting from public programs. For example, opinion poll data show that younger Americans report greater support for increased spending on Social Security than do older persons, while older adults are most likely to favor increased spending on education (Street and Cossman, 2006). Further, most Americans support Medicare and Social Security; a 2011 survey found that nearly 90 percent feel that both programs are “good for the country.” However, a 2015 Gallup poll found that two-thirds of Americans say Social Security is in a state of crisis or has major problems (Newport, 2015).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Americans may recognize that the old and young generations are not in competition; rather, benefits provided to one generation may help the other. At the same time, Americans’ anxieties about how to fund such benefits are well founded, as we will see in the next section.</p>
