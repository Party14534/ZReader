<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Before students were sent home in the spring of 2020 to learn remotely, the social order of a campus classroom was part of our routine experience: A professor looks out onto a lecture hall and sees a roomful of silent students taking notes and exhibiting self-control and discipline. There must be somebody in the room who wishes that he or she were doing yoga instead, or who would like to turn around and say something to a friend in the back. But the fact of the matter is that almost everyone appears to be doing the same thing: sitting quietly, listening, taking notes (or at least pretending to). How can we explain this orderly behavior? How can we explain the existence of social order in a lecture hall or in a society? We certainly need social order to get through the day, but how can we understand it?</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sociologists have offered up many different explanations to try to answer such questions. One explanation is that it is rational for individuals to act this way. Students know it is in their self-interest to sit quietly and pay attention. Perhaps a student hopes to apply to graduate school and wants to get a letter of recommendation from the professor. This goal motivates the student to respond to the classroom environment: The professor’s willingness to write a letter is an incentive for good behavior. The recommendation <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_9" title="9"></span>acts as an incentive, stimulating the response of the student who wants it. The student tries to make a good impression, all the while keeping in mind that if he or she turns around and talks to the friend in the back week after week instead of listening, the professor might write an unflattering letter or refuse to write one at all. This explanation based on self-interest and incentives is what economists would use to explain most things. While some sociologists adopt such theories, most find such explanations to be based on an all-too-narrow conception of human nature. They therefore appeal to a different set of theories.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Thus, another explanation for social order is the existence of norms. It is a norm of social life that when students come into a classroom, they sit and take notes and pay attention. We learn and internalize norms as young people through a process called <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-socialization" href="part0010_split_005.html#socialization">socialization</a>. Once we have internalized a norm, we tend to follow through with the expectations of the norm in most of our interactions. Norms are important to sociologists because they explain some of the ways in which we are inside society and, simultaneously, society is inside us.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Yet another explanation for social order focuses on beliefs and values. Perhaps students place a value on the classroom, on the university, or on higher education. If this is the case, then the social order upheld in classrooms is more than a norm. The lecture hall is a symbol of a greater whole, a sacred place that is part of a larger moral universe. Students sit quietly because they believe professors in this ceremonial order deserve respect, maybe even deference.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">It is important to keep in mind that we do not need to choose among these theories. Multiple factors can operate together. All these explanations address the question of social order from a sociological perspective. As such, the existence of social order is not taken for granted. For the average person, the question of social order arises in response to disruptions or breaks in that order. When students began doing remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was no longer necessary to look directly at the lecturer and pretend to be paying attention. Many students would turn their cameras off for long periods of time and the professor could not know if someone was doing yoga while listening, or whether they were listening at all.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The average person who sees an event such as the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, or the Sandy Hook school shooting on December 14, 2012, may ask, “How could this event have happened?” The sociologist reverses that question and instead asks, “How is it that disruptions in the social order do not happen more frequently?”</p>
