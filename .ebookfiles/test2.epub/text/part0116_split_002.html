<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_2">Diverse Conceptions of Human Sexuality</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Just as notions of health, illness, and medicine are shaped by sociohistorical and cultural contexts, human sexuality is a complex concept, tightly tied to cultural beliefs and contexts. Judith Lorber (1994) distinguished as many as 10 different sexual identities: straight (heterosexual) woman, straight man, lesbian woman, gay man, bisexual woman, bisexual man, transvestite woman (a woman who regularly dresses as a man), transvestite man (a man who regularly dresses as a woman), transsexual woman (a man who becomes a woman), and transsexual man (a woman who becomes a man). The terminology used to describe people’s sexualities has evolved since that time, with terms like transgender and noncisgender replacing the terms transsexual and transvestite, and the introduction of terms like gender fluid, genderqueer, gender nonconforming, and non-binary to reflect the fact that gender and sexuality do not sit neatly in the old boxes of male versus female, or gay versus straight (GLAAD, 2020). As we saw in <a href="part0065_split_000.html#1TVKI0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 10</a>, people today are more likely than ever before to define themselves in ways that may or may not match the body they were born into, blend these categories, or even move fluidly among the categories set forth by Lorber (GLAAD, 2020; Padawer, 2014; Schulman, 2013).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sexual practices themselves are even more diverse. Sigmund Freud argued that human beings are born with a wide range of sexual tastes that are ordinarily curbed through socialization—although some adults may follow these tastes even when, in a given society, these practices are regarded as immoral or illegal. Freud began his <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_715" title="715"></span>research during the Victorian period, when many people were sexually prudish, yet his patients still revealed an amazing diversity of sexual pursuits. Freud’s work underscores the complex ways that biology and social contexts shape human sexuality.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Among possible sexual practices are the following: A man or woman can have sexual relations with women, men, or both. This can happen with one partner at a time or with two or more partners participating. One can have sex with oneself (masturbation) or with no one (celibacy). One can have sexual relations with people who erotically cross-dress, use pornography or sexual devices, practice sadomasochism (the erotic use of bondage and the inflicting of pain), and so on (Lorber, 1994). In most societies, sexual norms encourage some practices and discourage or condemn others. Such norms, however, vary across cultures. Same-sex sexual relations is an example. As we will discuss later, some cultures have actively encouraged such relations in certain contexts. Among the ancient Greeks, for instance, the love of men for boys was idealized as the highest form of sexual love.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Accepted types of sexual behavior also vary between cultures, which indicates that most sexual responses are learned and not a product of solely biological forces. The most extensive cross-cultural study was carried out by Clellan Ford and Frank Beach (1951), using anthropological evidence from more than 200 societies. Striking variations were found in what was regarded as “natural” sexual behavior and in norms of sexual attractiveness. For example, in some cultures, extended foreplay is desirable and even necessary before intercourse; in others, foreplay is nonexistent. Some societies believe that overly frequent intercourse leads to physical debilitation or illness.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In most cultures, norms of sexual attractiveness (held by both females and males) focus more on physical looks for women than for men, a situation that may be changing worldwide as women become active in spheres outside the home. The traits seen as most important in female beauty, however, differ greatly. In wealthy industrialized nations, a slim, small physique is admired, while in other cultures, a more generous shape is attractive. Some societies consider the breasts a source of sexual stimulus, whereas other societies do not attach erotic significance to them. Some societies value the shape of the face, whereas others emphasize the shape and color of the eyes or the size and form of the nose and lips. Although anthropologists and sociologists focus on cross-cultural differences in mate-selection processes, evolutionary theorists emphasize universals since these purportedly universal practices contribute to the continuation of the human species. For instance, research by David Buss reveals widespread male preference for a relatively low waist-to-hip ratio in women (i.e., an “hourglass” figure) because it can be seen as an indicator of a woman’s reproductive fitness, or her ability to bear healthy offspring. Women, by contrast, are drawn to men with ambition and economic stability, which are considered indications of an ability to adequately provide for offspring (Buss, 2003).</p>
<section id="sexual-orientation">
<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Sexual Orientation</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Sexual orientation is an important component of human sexuality because it involves the direction of one’s sexual or romantic attraction. The term <i class="italic">sexual preference</i>, which is sometimes incorrectly used instead of <i class="italic">sexual orientation</i>, is misleading and should be avoided because it implies that one’s sexual or romantic attraction is entirely a matter of personal choice. As you will see, sexual orientation results from a complex interplay of biological and social factors not yet fully understood.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_716" title="716"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The most commonly found sexual orientation in all cultures, including the United States, is <i class="italic">heterosexuality</i>, a sexual or romantic attraction for persons of the opposite sex. In the United States, heterosexuals are also sometimes called “straight.” It is important to note that although heterosexuality may be the prevailing norm in most cultures, it is not “normal” in the sense of being dictated by some universal moral or religious standard. Like all behavior, heterosexual behavior is socially learned within a particular culture.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><i class="italic">Homosexuality</i> is the term historically used to describe a sexual or romantic attraction for persons of one’s own sex. However, that term is now considered offensive and new terms are widely used to describe those attracted to persons of the same sex. The term <i class="italic">gay</i> is used to refer to men who experience sexual desire toward other men, <i class="italic">lesbian</i> for women who experience sexual desire for other women, and <i class="italic">bi</i> as shorthand for <i class="italic">bisexual</i>, which is used to describe people who are sexually attracted to both men and women. Young people increasingly use the term <i class="italic">queer</i> to describe a person whose sexual orientation is not exclusively heterosexual, as they find the gender-specific terms gay and lesbian to be too limiting (GLAAD, 2020). Researchers estimate that approximately 3.5 to 8 percent of the population in the United States identifies as LGB (lesbian, gay, or bisexual), although these numbers may be underestimates because of the stigma that sexual minorities still face in some communities (Gates, 2013; Laumann et al., 1994). According to the latest General Social Survey, 3.3 percent of Americans identify as bisexual, and 1.7 percent identify as gay or lesbian as of 2018 (Burkholder, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The term <i class="italic">homosexuality</i> has a troubled history. It was first used by the medical community in 1869 to characterize what was then regarded as a personality disorder. The American Psychiatric Association did not remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses until 1973, or from its influential <i class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (DSM) until 1980. These long-overdue steps were taken only after prolonged lobbying and pressure by gay rights organizations. The medical community was belatedly forced to acknowledge that no scientific research had ever found gays and lesbians as a group to be psychologically unhealthier than heterosexuals (Burr, 1993). However, the DSM-IV continues to classify other aspects of sexuality as “disorders,” including disorders of desire (e.g., low interest in sex), disorders of sexual arousal (e.g., lubrication and erectile problems), and orgasmic disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Even the updated DSM-V, published in 2013, defines individuals as possessing gender dysphoria if they are intensely uncomfortable with their assigned gender and strongly identify with, and want to become, the opposite gender (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This diagnosis does not accurately represent the experiences of transgender or noncisgender people who are comfortable with their gender identity differing from the sex they were assigned at birth.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_717" title="717"></span>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">In a small number of cultures, same-sex relationships are the norm in certain contexts and do not necessarily signify what today is termed LGBTQ identities. For example, the anthropologist Gilbert Herdt (1981, 1984, 1986) reported that among more than 20 tribes in Melanesia and New Guinea, ritually prescribed same-sex encounters among young men and boys were considered necessary for subsequent masculine virility (Herdt and Davidson, 1988). Ritualized male-male sexual encounters also occurred among the Azande of Africa’s Sudan and Congo (Evans-Pritchard, 1970), Japanese samurai warriors in the nineteenth century (Leupp, 1995), and highly educated Greek men and boys in the time of Plato (Rousselle, 1999). These examples underscore the importance of social and historical contexts in shaping sexuality.</p>
