<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">World-systems theory builds on the concept of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-global-commodity-chains" href="part0061_split_006.html#global-commodity-chains">global commodity chains</a>, worldwide networks of labor and production processes that extend from raw materials to the final consumer (Appelbaum and Christerson, 1997; Bair, 2009; Gereffi, 1995, 1996; Gereffi, Fernandez-Stark, and Psilos, 2011; Hopkins and Wallerstein, 1996). The globalization of production through commodity chains began to increase in the 1970s and accelerated throughout the twentieth and early twenty-first century (<a href="part0090_split_000.html#2LQIK0-867b87aa7274459d98184a3ea2c9ae3d">Chapter 14</a>). The commodity chain approach emphasizes the increasingly globalized nature of production, as corporations based in high-income countries now outsource most of their manufacturing to independently owned contract factories in lower-income countries in search of the lowest costs and fewest environmental restrictions. As production goes global, lower-income countries compete with one another to get the factories. The most profitable part of the global commodity chain, typically headquartered in high-income countries, is made up of the brands that design the goods we all consume and the giant retailers that sell them. The least profitable part is found in low-income countries, and includes many of the low-wage factories that actually produce the goods.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Apple, a giant global corporation whose wide variety of consumer electronic products source their components from 200 principal suppliers (Apple, 2019), provides an excellent example of how commodity chains work. Consider the iPhone 11 Pro Max, whose 2020 sales price ranged from $1,000 to $1,450, depending on storage capacity. The iPhone actually costs only $491 to manufacture, once the cost of all its components are added up. The most profitable part of the its global commodity chain—design, creating brand identification, and marketing—is occupied by Apple, which is headquartered in Cupertino, located in California’s famed Silicon Valley. Further down the commodity chain, where actual manufacturing occurs, the iPhone’s most expensive component, the camera/image (costing $74 to make), was manufactured by the Korean corporation Samsung. The next most expensive item, the display/touchscreen (costing $67), was also mainly made by Samsung, although another Korean company, LG Display, also provided some screens. The numerous suppliers of its other components span the globe, requiring extremely tight coordination in order for Apple to meet its delivery goals. Although most people think of the iPhone as being made in China, what mainly occurs there is its final assembly (costing $21). This represents just 4 percent of its total cost, and only 1–2 percent of its retail price. Moreover, the factories that assemble iPhones in China—along with smartphones, tablets, computers, and other electronic gadgets for virtually all major consumer electronics corporations—are not even Chinese factories: they are owned by Foxconn, a global Taiwanese corporation that employs more than a million workers in China alone (Yang, Wegner, and Cowsky, 2019).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">While the emergence of globalized commodity chains as a dominant form of manufacturing production has resulted in job loss in the United States, it has had the opposite effect in many of the countries where the jobs relocated. In East Asia in particular, commodity chains provided a pathway to economic development. China, for example, began its economic growth as the “world’s factory,” manufacturing everything from clothing and athletic shoes to the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Factory work in China is often <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_301" title="301"></span>dangerous and poorly paid; labor unions are controlled by the government, and workers have little choice but to suffer harsh conditions (Appelbaum and Lichtenstein, 2016). In one case that went viral in 2010, the pressure-cooker atmosphere demanded of the workers, reinforced by the Chinese government, resulted in despondent workers leaping from the upper floors of a giant Foxconn factory in south China; fourteen workers lost their lives (Ngai, Chan, and Selden, 2014). Yet at the same time, for many workers such manufacturing jobs have provided the first rung on the economic ladder, preferable to the impoverished rural lives they had left behind. And over several decades, Chinese factory workers became consumers, helping to drive China’s emerging economy. The Chinese government invested heavily in science and technology, and, as we have seen, the Chinese economy took off, raising hundreds of millions out of poverty (Appelbaum et al, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Immanuel Wallerstein, the founder of world-systems theory, drew on ideas from both dependency theory and global commodity chains (Hopkins and Wallerstein, 1996). In Wallerstein’s view, global commodity chains are best understood as containing core and peripheral activities that result in unequal and exploitative relations between countries. In our example, Apple’s highly profitable design and marketing activities are core, while final assembly in Foxconn factories is peripheral. Moreover, what constitutes a core or peripheral commodity chain activity can change over time: Manufacturing was a highly profitable core activity in the mid-twentieth century, enabling U.S. workers in unionized factories to achieve middle-class status. But when manufacturing moved to poor countries, it often became a peripheral activity, generating low wages and little profit. Wallerstein added a third category to dependency theory’s core and periphery: the <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-semiperiphery" href="part0061_split_006.html#semiperiphery">semiperiphery.</a> Semiperipheral countries are those that supply labor and raw materials to core industrial countries in the world economy, while at the same time profiting by extracting labor and raw materials from peripheral countries. Examples include Mexico in North America; Argentina, Brazil, and possibly Chile in South America; and some emerging economies of East Asia. The semiperiphery constitutes a kind of world middle class, and therefore offers the promise of economic growth to poorer countries in the periphery.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Wallerstein’s <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-world-systems-theory" href="part0061_split_006.html#world-systems-theory">world-systems theory</a> sees the world capitalist economic system not merely as a collection of independent countries engaged in diplomatic and economic relations with one another, but rather as a single economic unit (Wallerstein, 1974a, 1974b, 1979, 1990, 1996, 2004). The ability of countries to move up, from periphery to semiperiphery or from semiperiphery to core, is severely limited, but it does sometimes happen. Many East Asian countries, for example, have moved from the periphery to the semiperiphery—and some regions of those countries, such as those containing their leading cities, increasingly resemble the core. China, as previously noted, in world-systems terms seems soon to join the core. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_302" title="302"></span>The reasons for such successes are debated, but world-systems theory would attribute them, at least in part, to their strong states. Unlike neoliberal theories, world-systems theory argues that strong governments do not necessarily interfere with economic development, but rather can be key in promoting it. Considerable research now suggests that in some regions, such as East Asia, successful economic development has been state-led. Strong governments contributed in various ways to economic growth in the emerging economies of East Asia during the 1980s and 1990s (Amsden, Kochanowicz, and Taylor, 1994; Appelbaum and Henderson, 1992; Cumings, 1997; Evans, 1995; World Bank, 1997). More recently, the government of China has shown how massive public investment can propel a poor country into upper-middle-income status, raising, as we have seen, hundreds of millions of people out of rural poverty. The Chinese government has spent trillions of dollars on economic development, including national networks of high-speed highways and 200 mph trains, large-scale investments in science and technology, and building entire cities and science parks (Appelbaum et al, 2018).</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although the world system changes very slowly, once-powerful countries in the core eventually lose their economic power over others. According to world-systems theory, some five centuries ago the Italian city-states of Venice and Genoa dominated the world capitalist economy, but eventually, they were superseded by the Dutch, who were then superseded by the British, who were then, in turn, superseded by the United States. Today, American dominance may be giving way to a more “multipolar” world where economic power will be shared among the United States, Europe, and Asia—or perhaps will yield to a rising China (Arrighi, 1994).</p>
