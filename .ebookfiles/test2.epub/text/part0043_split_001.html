<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">The “McDonaldization” of Society?</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">George Ritzer (1993) developed a vivid metaphor to express his view of the transformations in industrialized societies. He argues that we are witnessing the “McDonaldization” of society—“the process by which the principles of the fast-food restaurant are coming to dominate more and more sectors of American society as well as the rest of the world.” Ritzer uses the four guiding principles of McDonald’s restaurants—efficiency, calculability, uniformity, and control through automation—to show that our society is becoming ever more rationalized.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">If you have visited a McDonald’s in two different countries, you will have noticed that few differences exist between them. The interior decoration may vary slightly, and the language used will most likely differ, but the layout, the menu, the procedure for ordering, the uniforms, the tables, the packaging, and the “service with a smile” are <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_185" title="185"></span>virtually identical. The McDonald’s experience is designed to be the same whether you are in Bogota or Beijing. No matter where they are, McDonald’s customers can expect quick service with a minimum of fuss and a standardized product that is reassuringly consistent. The McDonald’s system is constructed to maximize efficiency and minimize human responsibility and involvement in the process. Except for certain key tasks, such as taking orders and pushing the Start and Stop buttons on cooking equipment, the restaurants’ functions are highly automated and largely run themselves.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Ritzer argues that society as a whole is moving toward this highly standardized and regulated model. Many aspects of our daily lives, for example, now involve automated systems and computers instead of human beings. Email and texts are replacing letters and phone calls; e-commerce is threatening to overtake trips to the store; ATMs outnumber bank tellers; and prepackaged meals provide a quicker option than cooking. And if you have recently tried to call a large organization such as an airline, you know that it is almost impossible to speak to a human being. Automated touch-tone information services are designed to answer your requests; only in certain cases will you be connected to a live employee. Ritzer, like Weber before him, is fearful of the harmful effects of rationalization on the human spirit and creativity. He argues that McDonaldization is making social life more homogeneous, more rigid, and less personal.</p>
