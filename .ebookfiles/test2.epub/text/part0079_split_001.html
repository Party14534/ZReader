<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">The First Generation of Theories: Functionalism</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">The earliest theories of aging reflected the functionalist approach that was dominant in sociology during the 1950s and 1960s. These early theories often assumed that aging brings with it physical and psychological decline and that changing social roles should take into account this decline (Hendricks, 1992). Functionalist theories, in particular, emphasized how individuals adjusted to changing social roles as they aged and how the roles older adults fulfilled were useful to society.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Talcott Parsons (1960), one of the most influential functionalist theorists of the 1950s, argued that U.S. society needs to find roles for older persons that are compatible with their advanced age. He expressed concern that the United States, with its emphasis on youth and its denial of death, had failed to provide roles that adequately drew on the potential wisdom and maturity of its older citizens. This failure could lead to older people becoming discouraged and alienated from society. To achieve a “healthy maturity,” Parsons (1960) argued, older adults need to adjust psychologically to their changed circumstances, while society needs to redefine the social roles of the older population.</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_1">Disengagement Theory</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Parsons’s ideas set the stage for the development of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-disengagement-theory" href="part0079_split_004.html#disengagement-theory">disengagement theory</a>, which asserts that it is functional for society to relieve people of their traditional roles when they become old, thereby freeing up those roles for other, younger persons (Cumming and Henry, 1961; Estes, Binney, and Culbertson, 1992). According to this perspective, given the increasing frailty, illness, and dependency of older persons, it becomes increasingly dysfunctional for them to occupy roles they are no longer capable of adequately fulfilling. Older adults should therefore retire from their jobs, pull back from civic life, and eventually withdraw from their other activities and relationships. Disengagement is assumed to be functional for society because it opens up roles formerly filled by the older adults for younger people, who presumably will carry them out with fresh energy and new skills. Disengagement also is assumed to be functional for older adults because it enables them to abandon potentially taxing social roles and instead invest their energies in more private introspective activities as they prepare for their eventual demise.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Although there is some empirical support and ample anecdotal evidence for the validity of disengagement theory, the idea that old people should completely disengage from the larger society presumes that old age necessarily involves frailty and dependence. This is an incorrect assumption; one in five older adults lives disease-free (Schafer and Ferraro, 2011), and 7 percent of deaths in old age occur suddenly, meaning the older person had no illness prior to death (Lunney et al. 2003). Recent studies suggest that selective disengagement from some roles—rather than complete disengagement from all roles—can be healthy if the older adult chooses which roles to drop and which to maintain. For example, most retirees report quite high levels of life satisfaction; however, the happiest retirees are those in good health, with strong social ties, adequate financial resources, and engagement in other productive activities, such as volunteering or part-time work (Atchley, 2000; Barnes and Parry, 2004).</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Scholars also have found that older adults may cut back on the number of social relationships they maintain, often dropping those relationships that are not a source of great joy or support. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-socioemotional-selectivity-theory" href="part0079_split_004.html#socioemotional-selectivity-theory">Socioemotional selectivity theory</a> states that older adults selectively choose to maintain fewer, but higher-quality, relationships as they age and experience declines in health. Casual, less rewarding ties may lapse, while only the most meaningful relationships are maintained (Carstensen, Isaacowitz, and Charles, 1999).</p>

<h3 class="cc-header" id="toc_2">Activity Theory</h3>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Given this strong evidence that disengagement from all social roles is rare, and such disengagement does not ease the aging process, the very assumptions of disengagement theory have been challenged, often by some of the theory’s original proponents (Cumming, 1963, 1975; Hendricks, 1992; Henry, <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page_428" title="428"></span>1965; Hochschild, 1975; Maddox, 1965, 1970). These challenges gave rise to another functionalist theory of aging, which drew conclusions quite opposite to those of disengagement theory: activity theory.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">According to <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-activity-theory" href="part0079_split_004.html#activity-theory">activity theory</a>, people who are busy and engaged, leading fulfilling and productive lives, can be functional for society. The guiding assumption is that an active individual is much more likely to remain healthy, alert, and socially useful. In this view, people should remain engaged in their work and other social roles as long as they are capable of doing so. If a time comes when a particular role becomes too difficult or taxing, then other roles can be sought—for example, volunteer work in the community.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Activity theory is supported by research showing that continued activity well into old age—whether it’s volunteer work, paid employment, hobbies, or visits with friends and family—is associated with enhanced mental and physical health (Birren and Bengston, 1988; Rowe and Kahn, 1987; Schaie, 1983). Yet critics observe that not all activities are equally valuable, giving rise to the development of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-continuity-theory" href="part0079_split_004.html#continuity-theory">continuity theory</a>. This theory specifies that older adults’ well-being is enhanced when they participate in activities that are consistent with their personality, preferences, and activities earlier in life (Atchley, 1989). For instance, a retired elementary school teacher may find volunteering at a local elementary school to be much more satisfying than taking bus trips to Atlantic City or playing bingo at a local community center.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Critics of functionalist theories of aging argue that these theories emphasize the need for older persons to adapt to existing conditions, by either disengaging from socially useful roles or actively pursuing them, but that they do not question whether the circumstances older adults face are just. In response to this criticism, another group of theorists arose—those growing out of the social-conflict tradition (Hendricks, 1992).</p>
