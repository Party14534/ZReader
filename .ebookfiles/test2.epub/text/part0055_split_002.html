<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">There are three main differences between Weber’s theory and that of Marx. First, according to Weber, class divisions derive not only from control or lack of control of the means of production, but also from economic differences that have nothing to do with property. Such resources include people’s skills and credentials. Those in managerial or professional occupations earn more and enjoy more favorable conditions at work, for example, than do people in blue-collar jobs. Their qualifications, such as degrees, diplomas, and skills they have acquired, make them more “marketable” than others without such qualifications. At a lower level, among blue-collar workers, skilled craft workers secure higher wages than do the semiskilled or unskilled.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Second, Weber distinguished another aspect of stratification, which he called “status.” <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-status" href="part0055_split_005.html#status">Status</a> refers to differences among groups in the social honor, or prestige, that others accord them. Status distinctions can vary independently of class divisions. Social honor may be either positive or negative. For instance, doctors and lawyers have high prestige in American society. <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-pariah-groups" href="part0055_split_005.html#pariah-groups">Pariah groups</a>, on the other hand, are negatively privileged status groups subject to discrimination that prevents them from taking advantage of opportunities open to others. The Jews were a pariah group in medieval Europe, banned from participating in certain occupations and from holding official positions.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Possession of wealth normally confers high status, but there are exceptions, such as Hollywood starlets who earn high salaries but lack the education or refinement typically associated with “status.” In Britain, individuals from aristocratic families enjoy social esteem even after their fortunes have been lost, but individuals with “new money” are often scorned by the well-established wealthy. Whereas class is an objective measure, status depends on people’s subjective evaluations of social differences. Classes derive from the economic factors associated with property and earnings; status is governed by the varying lifestyles that groups follow.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Third, Weber recognized that social classes also differ with respect to their power, or ability to enact change, command resources, or make decisions. Power is distinct from status and class, but these three dimensions often overlap. For example, on most college campuses, the president or provost has much greater power to change campus policies than does a cafeteria worker.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Weber’s writings on stratification show that other dimensions besides class strongly influence people’s lives. Most sociologists hold that Weber’s scheme offers a more flexible and sophisticated basis for analyzing stratification than that provided by Marx.</p>
