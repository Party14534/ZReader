<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Any satisfactory account of the nature of crime must be sociological because what crime is depends on the social institutions of a society. Contemporary sociological thinking about crime emphasizes that definitions of conformity and deviance vary based on one’s social context. Modern societies contain many subcultures, and behavior that conforms to the norms of one subculture may be regarded as deviant outside it; for instance, a member of a gang may feel strong pressure to prove himself by stealing a car. Moreover, wide divergences of wealth and power in society greatly influence criminal opportunities for different groups. Theft and burglary, not surprisingly, are carried out mainly by people from the poorer segments of the population; embezzlement and tax evasion are by definition limited to persons in positions of some affluence.</p>
