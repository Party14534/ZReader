<p class="soc-titles-blue-text"><a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-urbanization" href="part0123_split_005.html#urbanization">Urbanization</a>—the movement of the population into towns and cities, away from rural farmland—results when cities grow in population, perhaps partly through natural increase but mainly through migration from rural areas by people in search of the economic opportunities associated with urban life. During the twentieth century and for the first time in history, humans have opted for large-scale urban living rather than rural life. This change has had enormous consequences not only for individuals, but for the planetary environment as well. Before we turn to some of these consequences, however, it is important to understand how sociologists have viewed urban life, since such understanding played a major role in the emergence of the discipline during the twentieth century. We begin with scholars associated with the University of Chicago’s so-called “Chicago School” from the 1920s to the 1940s—especially Robert Park, Ernest Burgess, and Louis Wirth—who developed ideas that were, for many years, the chief basis of theory and research in urban sociology. Some important ideas, however, came from outside universities—for example, in the work of Jane Jacobs, whom we will also consider. We will also examine some other leading theories of urban sociology, before examining city life throughout the world today.</p>
