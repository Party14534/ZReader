<h2 class="front-section-title" id="calibre_pb_1">Democratic Elitism</h2>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">One of the most influential views of the nature and limits of modern democracy was set out by Max Weber and, in modified form, by economist Joseph Schumpeter (1983; orig. 1942). Their ideas are called the theory of <a role="doc-glossref" id="refover-democratic-elitism" href="part0085_split_004.html#democratic-elitism">democratic elitism</a>.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Weber held that direct democracy is impossible as a means of regular government in large-scale societies—not only for the logistical reason that millions of people cannot meet to make political decisions, but also because running a complex society demands expertise. Participatory democracy, Weber believed, can succeed only in small organizations where the work is straightforward. When complicated decisions or policies are involved, even in modest-sized groups, such as small business firms, specialized knowledge and skills are necessary. Because experts carry out their jobs on a continuous basis, positions requiring expertise cannot be subject to regular election by people with vague knowledge of the necessary skills and information. Although higher officials, responsible for overall policy decisions, are elected, a large substratum of full-time bureaucratic officials must play a large part in running a country (Weber, 1979; orig. 1921). In Weber’s view, the development of mass citizenship, which is closely connected with the idea of general democratic participation, greatly expands the need for bureaucratic officialdom. For example, provision for welfare, health, and education requires permanent, large-scale administrative systems.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Representative multiparty democracy, according to Weber, helps defend against both arbitrary decision making on the part of political leaders (because they are subject to popular elections) and power being completely usurped by bureaucrats (because elected officials set overall policy). But under these circumstances, the contribution of democratic institutions falls short of achieving pure democracy. “Rule by the people” is possible in only a very limited sense. To achieve power, political parties must become organized in a systematic way—they must become bureaucratized. “Party machines” then develop that threaten the autonomy of parliaments or congresses in discussing and formulating policies. If a party with a majority representation can dictate policy, and if that party is run by officials who are permanently in control, then the level of democracy is low.</p>

<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">For democratic systems to be effective, Weber argued, two conditions must be met. First, there must be parties that represent different interests and have different outlooks. If the policies of competing parties are basically the same, voters lack any effective choice. Weber held that one-party systems cannot be democratic in any meaningful way. Second, there must be political leaders with imagination and the courage to escape the inertia of bureaucracy. Weber emphasized the importance of leadership in democracy, which is why his view is known as democratic elitism: Rule by elites is inevitable; ideally, they will represent our interests in an innovative and insightful fashion. Parliaments and congresses give rise to political leaders who can counter the influence of bureaucracy and command mass support. Weber valued multiparty democracy more for the quality of leadership it generates than for the mass participation in politics it makes possible.</p>
<p class="soc-titles-blue-text">Joseph Schumpeter (1983) agreed with Weber about the limits of mass political participation and about democracy being important as a method of generating effective and responsible government. For Schumpeter, as for Weber, democracy is more important as a method of generating effective and responsible government than as a means of providing significant power for the majority. Democracy, Schumpeter stated, is the rule of the politician, not the people. To achieve voting support, however, politicians must be minimally responsive to the demands and interests of the electorate. Only if there is competition to secure votes can arbitrary rule be avoided.</p>
