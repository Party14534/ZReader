<h1 id="preface" class="calibre99">Preface</h1>

<p class="calibre9">There are two kinds of cryptography in this world: cryptography that will stop
your kid sister from reading your files, and cryptography that will stop major
governments from reading your files. This book is about the latter.</p>

<p class="calibre9">If I take a letter, lock it in a safe, hide the safe somewhere in New York, then
tell you to read the letter, that’s not security. That’s obscurity. On the other
hand, if I take a letter and lock it in a safe, and then give you the safe along
with the design specifications of the safe and a hundred identical safes with
their combinations so that you and the world’s best safecrackers can study the
locking mechanism — and you still can’t open the safe and read the
letter — that’s security.</p>

<p class="calibre9">For many years, this sort of cryptography was the exclusive domain of the
military. The United States’ National Security Agency (NSA), and its
counterparts in the former Soviet Union, England, France, Israel, and
elsewhere, have spent billions of dollars in the very serious game of securing
their own communications while trying to break everyone else’s. Private
individuals, with far less expertise and budget, have been powerless to protect
their own privacy against these governments.</p>

<p class="calibre9">During the last 20 years, public academic research in cryptography has
exploded. While classical cryptography has been long used by ordinary
citizens, computer cryptography was the exclusive domain of the world’s
militaries since World War II. Today, state–of–the–art computer cryptography
is practiced outside the secured walls of the military agencies. The layperson
can now employ security practices that can protect against the most powerful
of adversaries — security that may protect against military agencies for years to
come.</p>

<p class="calibre9">Do average people really need this kind of security? Yes. They may be
planning a political campaign, discussing taxes, or having an illicit affair. They
may be designing a new product, discussing a marketing strategy, or planning
a hostile business takeover. Or they may be living in a country that does not
respect the rights of privacy of its citizens. They may be doing something that
they feel shouldn’t be illegal, but is. For whatever reason, the data and
communications are personal, private, and no one else’s business.</p>

<p class="calibre9">This book is being published in a tumultuous time. In 1994, the Clinton
administration approved the Escrowed Encryption Standard (including the
Clipper chip and Fortezza card) and signed the Digital Telephony bill into law.
Both of these initiatives try to ensure the government’s ability to conduct
electronic surveillance.</p>

<p class="calibre9">Some dangerously Orwellian assumptions are at work here: that the
government has the right to listen to private communications, and that there is
something wrong with a private citizen trying to keep a secret from the
government. Law enforcement has always been able to conduct
court–authorized surveillance if possible, but this is the first time that the
people have been forced to take active measures to <i class="calibre12">make themselves available</i>
for surveillance. These initiatives are not simply government proposals in
some obscure area; they are preemptive and unilateral attempts to usurp
powers that previously belonged to the people.</p>

<p class="calibre9">Clipper and Digital Telephony do not protect privacy; they force individuals to
unconditionally trust that the government will respect their privacy. The same
law enforcement authorities who illegally tapped Martin Luther King Jr.’s
phones can easily tap a phone protected with Clipper. In the recent past, local
police authorities have either been charged criminally or sued civilly in
numerous jurisdictions — Maryland, Connecticut, Vermont, Georgia, Missouri,
and Nevada — for conducting illegal wiretaps. It’s a poor idea to deploy a
technology that could some day facilitate a police state.</p>

<p class="calibre9">The lesson here is that it is insufficient to protect ourselves with laws; we need
to protect ourselves with mathematics. Encryption is too important to be left
solely to governments.</p>

<p class="calibre9">This book gives you the tools you need to protect your own privacy;
cryptography products may be declared illegal, but the information will never
be.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_toc_36" class="calibre102">How to Read This Book</h2>

<p class="calibre9">I wrote <i class="calibre12">Applied Cryptography</i> to be both a lively introduction to the field of
cryptography and a comprehensive reference. I have tried to keep the text
readable without sacrificing accuracy. This book is not intended to be a
mathematical text. Although I have not deliberately given any false
information, I do play fast and loose with theory. For those interested in
formalism, there are copious references to the academic literature.</p>

<p class="calibre9"><a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_001.html#1" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapter 1</a> introduces cryptography, defines many terms, and briefly discusses
precomputer cryptography.</p>

<p class="calibre9"><a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_003.html#2" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapters 2</a> through <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_007.html#6" class="calibre5 pcalibre">6</a> (Part I) describe cryptographic protocols: what people
can do with cryptography. The protocols range from the simple (sending
encrypted messages from one person to another) to the complex (flipping a
coin over the telephone) to the esoteric (secure and anonymous digital money
exchange). Some of these protocols are obvious; others are almost amazing.
Cryptography can solve a lot of problems that most people never realized it
could.</p>

<p class="calibre9"><a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_009.html#7" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapters 7</a> through <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_012.html#10" class="calibre5 pcalibre">10</a> (Part II) discuss cryptographic techniques. All four
chapters in this section are important for even the most basic uses of
cryptography. <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_009.html#7" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapters 7</a> and <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_010.html#8" class="calibre5 pcalibre">8</a> are about keys: how long a key should be in
order to be secure, how to generate keys, how to store keys, how to dispose of
keys, and so on. Key management is the hardest part of cryptography and often
the Achilles’ heel of an otherwise secure system. <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_011.html#9" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapter 9</a> discusses different
ways of using cryptographic algorithms, and <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_012.html#10" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapter 10</a> gives the odds and
ends of algorithms: how to choose, implement, and use algorithms.</p>

<p class="calibre9"><a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_014.html#11" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapters 11</a> through <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_026.html#23" class="calibre5 pcalibre">23</a> (Part III) list algorithms. <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_014.html#11" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapter 11</a> provides the
mathematical background. This chapter is only required if you are interested in
public–key algorithms. If you just want to implement DES (or something
similar), you can skip ahead. <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_015.html#12" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapter 12</a> discusses DES: the algorithm, its
history, its security, and some variants. <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_016.html#13" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapters 13</a>, <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_017.html#14" class="calibre5 pcalibre">14</a>, and <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_018.html#15" class="calibre5 pcalibre">15</a> discuss other
block algorithms; if you want something more secure than DES, skip to the
section on IDEA and triple–DES. If you want to read about a bunch of
algorithms, some of which may be more secure than DES, read the whole
chapter. <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_019.html#16" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapters 16</a> and <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_020.html#17" class="calibre5 pcalibre">17</a> discuss stream algorithms. <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_021.html#18" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapter 18</a> focuses on
one–way hash functions; MD5 and SHA are the most common, although I
discuss many more. <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_022.html#19" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapter 19</a> discusses public–key encryption algorithms,
<a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_023.html#20" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapter 20</a> discusses public–key digital signature algorithms, <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_024.html#21" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapter 21</a>
discusses public–key identification algorithms, and <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_025.html#22" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapter 22</a> discusses
public–key key exchange algorithms. The important algorithms are RSA,
DSA, Fiat–Shamir, and Diffie–Hellman, respectively. <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_026.html#23" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapter 23</a> has more
esoteric public–key algorithms and protocols; the math in this chapter is quite
complicated, so wear your seat belt.</p>

<p class="calibre9"><a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_028.html#24" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapters 24</a> and <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_029.html#25" class="calibre5 pcalibre">25</a> (Part IV) turn to the real world of cryptography. <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_028.html#24" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapter 24</a> 
discusses some of the current implementations of these algorithms and
protocols, while <a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_029.html#25" class="calibre5 pcalibre">Chapter 25</a> touches on some of the political issues
surrounding cryptography. These chapters are by no means intended to be
comprehensive.</p>

<p class="calibre9">Also included are source code listings for 10 algorithms discussed in Part III. I
was unable to include all the code I wanted to due to space limitations, and
cryptographic source code cannot otherwise be exported. (Amazingly enough,
the State Department allowed export of the first edition of this book with
source code, but denied export for a computer disk with the exact same source
code on it. Go figure.) An associated source code disk set includes much more
source code than I could fit in this book; it is probably the largest collection of
cryptographic source code outside a military institution. I can only send source
code disks to U.S. and Canadian citizens living in the U.S. and Canada, but
hopefully that will change someday. If you are interested in implementing or
playing with the cryptographic algorithms in this book, get the disk. See the
last page of the book for details.</p>

<p class="calibre9">One criticism of this book is that its encyclopedic nature takes away from its
readability. This is true, but I wanted to provide a single reference for those
who might come across an algorithm in the academic literature or in a product.
For those who are more interested in a tutorial, I apologize. A lot is being done
in the field; this is the first time so much of it has been gathered between two
covers. Even so, space considerations forced me to leave many things out. I
covered topics that I felt were important, practical, or interesting. If I couldn’t
cover a topic in depth, I gave references to articles and papers that did.</p>

<p class="calibre9">I have done my best to hunt down and eradicate all errors in this book, but
many have assured me that it is an impossible task. Certainly, the second
edition has far fewer errors than the first. An errata listing is available from me
and will be periodically posted to the Usenet newsgroup sci.crypt. If any
reader finds an error, please let me know. I’ll send the first person to find each
error in the book a free copy of the source code disk.</p>
