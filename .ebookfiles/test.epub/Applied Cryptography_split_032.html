<p class="calibre9">The literature of cryptography has a curious history. Secrecy, of course, has
always played a central role, but until the First World War, important
developments appeared in print in a more or less timely fashion and the field
moved forward in much the same way as other specialized disciplines. As late
as 1918, one of the most influential cryptanalytic papers of the twentieth
century, William F. Friedman’s monograph <i class="calibre12">The Index of Coincidence and Its Applications in Cryptography</i>, 
appeared as a research report of the private
Riverbank Laboratories [<a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_035.html#r577" class="calibre5 pcalibre">577</a>]. And this, despite the fact that the work had been
done as part of the war effort. In the same year Edward H. Hebern of Oakland,
California filed the first patent for a rotor machine [<a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_035.html#r710" class="calibre5 pcalibre">710</a>], the device destined to
be a mainstay of military cryptography for nearly 50 years.</p>

<p class="calibre9">After the First World War, however, things began to change. U.S. Army and
Navy organizations, working entirely in secret, began to make fundamental
advances in cryptography. During the thirties and forties a few basic papers
did appear in the open literature and several treatises on the subject were
published, but the latter were farther and farther behind the state of the art. By
the end of the war the transition was complete. With one notable exception, the
public literature had died. That exception was Claude Shannon’s paper “The
Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems,” which appeared in the <i class="calibre12">Bell System Technical Journal</i> 
in 1949 [<a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_036.html#r1432" class="calibre5 pcalibre">1432</a>]. It was similar to Friedman’s 1918
paper, in that it grew out of wartime work of Shannon’s. After the Second
World War ended it was declassified, possibly by mistake.</p>

<p class="calibre9">From 1949 until 1967 the cryptographic literature was barren. In that year a
different sort of contribution appeared: David Kahn’s history, <i class="calibre12">The Codebreakers</i> [<a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_035.html#r794" class="calibre5 pcalibre">794</a>]. 
It didn’t contain any new technical ideas, but it did
contain a remarkably complete history of what had gone before, including
mention of some things that the government still considered secret. The
significance of <i class="calibre12">The Codebreakers</i> lay not just in its remarkable scope, but also in the fact that it enjoyed good sales and made tens of thousands of people,
who had never given the matter a moment’s thought, aware of cryptography. A
trickle of new cryptographic papers began to be written.</p>

<p class="calibre9">At about the same time, Horst Feistel, who had earlier worked on identification
friend or foe devices for the Air Force, took his lifelong passion for
cryptography to the IBM Watson Laboratory in Yorktown Heights, New York.
There, he began development of what was to become the U.S. Data Encryption
Standard; by the early 1970s several technical reports on this subject by Feistel
and his colleagues had been made public by IBM [<a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_036.html#r1482" class="calibre5 pcalibre">1482</a>,<a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_036.html#r1484" class="calibre5 pcalibre">1484</a>,<a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_035.html#r552" class="calibre5 pcalibre">552</a>].</p>

<p class="calibre9">This was the situation when I entered the field in late 1972. The cryptographic
literature wasn’t abundant, but what there was included some very shiny
nuggets.</p>

<p class="calibre9">Cryptology presents a difficulty not found in normal academic disciplines: the
need for the proper interaction of cryptography and cryptanalysis. This arises
out of the fact that in the absence of real communications requirements, it is
easy to propose a system that appears unbreakable. Many academic designs are
so complex that the would–be cryptanalyst doesn’t know where to start;
exposing flaws in these designs is far harder than designing them in the first
place. The result is that the competitive process, which is one strong
motivation in academic research, cannot take hold.</p>

<p class="calibre9">When Martin Hellman and I proposed public–key cryptography in 1975 [<a href="Applied%20Cryptography_split_035.html#r496" class="calibre5 pcalibre">496</a>],
one of the indirect aspects of our contribution was to introduce a problem that
does not even appear easy to solve. Now an aspiring cryptosystem designer
could produce something that would be recognized as clever — something that
did more than just turn meaningful text into nonsense. The result has been a
spectacular increase in the number of people working in cryptography, the
number of meetings held, and the number of books and papers published.</p>

<p class="calibre9">In my acceptance speech for the Donald E. Fink award — given for the best
expository paper to appear in an IEEE journal — which I received jointly with
Hellman in 1980, I told the audience that in writing “Privacy and
Authentication,” I had an experience that I suspected was rare even among the
prominent scholars who populate the IEEE awards ceremony: I had written the
paper I had wanted to study, but could not find, when I first became seriously
interested in cryptography. Had I been able to go to the Stanford bookstore and
pick up a modern cryptography text, I would probably have learned about the
field years earlier. But the only things available in the fall of 1972 were a few
classic papers and some obscure technical reports.</p>

<p class="calibre9">The contemporary researcher has no such problem. The problem now is
choosing where to start among the thousands of papers and dozens of books.
The contemporary researcher, yes, but what about the contemporary
programmer or engineer who merely wants to use cryptography? Where does
that person turn? Until now, it has been necessary to spend long hours hunting
out and then studying the research literature before being able to design the
sort of cryptographic utilities glibly described in popular articles.</p>

<p class="calibre9">This is the gap that Bruce Schneier’s <i class="calibre12">Applied Cryptography</i> has come to fill.
Beginning with the objectives of communication security and elementary
examples of programs used to achieve these objectives, Schneier gives us a
panoramic view of the fruits of 20 years of public research. The title says it all;
from the mundane objective of having a secure conversation the very first time
you call someone to the possibilities of digital money and cryptographically
secure elections, this is where you’ll find it.</p>

<p class="calibre9">Not satisfied that the book was about the real world merely because it went all
the way down to the code, Schneier has included an account of the world in
which cryptography is developed and applied, and discusses entities ranging
from the International Association for Cryptologic Research to the NSA.</p>

<p class="calibre9">When public interest in cryptography was just emerging in the late seventies
and early eighties, the National Security Agency (NSA), America’s official
cryptographic organ, made several attempts to quash it. The first was a letter
from a long–time NSA employee allegedly, avowedly, and apparently acting
on his own. The letter was sent to the IEEE and warned that the publication of
cryptographic material was a violation of the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (ITAR). This viewpoint turned out not even to be supported by the
regulations themselves — which contained an explicit exemption for published
material — but gave both the public practice of cryptography and the 1977
Information Theory Workshop lots of unexpected publicity.</p>

<p class="calibre9">A more serious attempt occurred in 1980, when the NSA funded the American
Council on Education to examine the issue with a view to persuading Congress
to give it legal control of publications in the field of cryptography. The results
fell far short of NSA’s ambitions and resulted in a program of voluntary
review of cryptographic papers; researchers were requested to ask the NSA’s
opinion on whether disclosure of results would adversely affect the national
interest before publication.</p>

<p class="calibre9">As the eighties progressed, pressure focused more on the practice than the
study of cryptography. Existing laws gave the NSA the power, through the
Department of State, to regulate the export of cryptographic equipment. As
business became more and more international and the American fraction of the
world market declined, the pressure to have a single product in both domestic
and offshore markets increased. Such single products were subject to export
control and thus the NSA acquired substantial influence not only over what
was exported, but also over what was sold in the United States.
As this is written, a new challenge confronts the public practice of
cryptography. The government has augmented the widely published and
available Data Encryption Standard, with a secret algorithm implemented in
tamper–resistant chips. These chips will incorporate a codified mechanism of
government monitoring. The negative aspects of this “key–escrow” program
range from a potentially disastrous impact on personal privacy to the high cost
of having to add hardware to products that had previously encrypted in
software. So far key escrow products are enjoying less than stellar sales and
the scheme has attracted widespread negative comment, especially from the
independent cryptographers. Some people, however, see more future in
programming than politicking and have redoubled their efforts to provide the
world with strong cryptography that is accessible to public scrutiny.</p>

<p class="calibre9">A sharp step back from the notion that export control law could supersede the
First Amendment seemed to have been taken in 1980 when the <i class="calibre12">Federal Register</i> 
announcement of a revision to ITAR included the statement:
“...provision has been added to make it clear that the regulation of the export
of technical data does not purport to interfere with the First Amendment rights
of individuals.” But the fact that tension between the First Amendment and the
export control laws has not gone away should be evident from statements at a
conference held by RSA Data Security. NSA’s representative from the export
control office expressed the opinion that people who published cryptographic
programs were “in a grey area” with respect to the law. If that is so, it is a grey
area on which the first edition of this book has shed some light. Export
applications for the book itself have been granted, with acknowledgement that
published material lay beyond the authority of the Munitions Control Board.
Applications to export the enclosed programs on disk, however, have been
denied.</p>

<p class="calibre9">The shift in the NSA’s strategy, from attempting to control cryptographic
research to tightening its grip on the development and deployment of
cryptographic products, is presumably due to its realization that all the great
cryptographic papers in the world do not protect a single bit of traffic. Sitting
on the shelf, this volume may be able to do no better than the books and papers
that preceded it, but sitting next to a workstation, where a programmer is
writing cryptographic code, it just may.</p>
